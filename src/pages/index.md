I wear a few different hats: a writer, researcher, programmer & designer, and actor/director. I'm interested in getting free, soul-expanding film and theatre, beautiful software and tools for thought, and the potentials and perils of the future.

Right now most of my time is spent building my read-later/research organizing app, [Margins](https://margins.gg/).

This is my web home. My own experimental warehouse: a place to cultivate web space and seek digital texture.

I was born in Davis, CA, grew up in Rochester, NY, and currently live in Crown Heights, Brooklyn with my partner [Mari](https://marivialgolden.com). Iâ€™m of Armenian, Lebanese, Egyptian and Irish descent.
