I am a programmer, designer, writer, researcher, and performer. My background is in theatre and film. I enjoy crafting interfaces, thinking through software design, understanding media, and considering the possibilities of form and content. I'm interested in tools for thought, tools for creativity, and tools for liberation.

I recently finished a batch at the Recurse Center, where I built lots of cool things, worked with lots of great people, and thought a lot about human-computer interaction. I spend a lot of time building several projects, like my read-later/research organizing app, [Margins](https://margins.gg/). But I'm also currently open to work.

This is my web home. My own experimental warehouse: a place to cultivate web space and seek digital texture.

I was born in Davis, CA, grew up in Rochester, NY, and currently live in Crown Heights, Brooklyn with my partner [Mari](https://marivialgolden.com). Iâ€™m of Armenian, Lebanese, Egyptian and Irish descent.
