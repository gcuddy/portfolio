“In Peter, **deftly portrayed by Gus Cuddy**, we find Anne’s male coming-of-age counterpart who deftly conveys what it is like to lurch from awkward, self-conscious adolescent to thoughtful, intelligent young man, who becomes Anne’s love interest.” [(Beyond the Nest)](https://rochester.beyondthenest.com/content/beyond-nests-review-gevas-diary-anne-frank)

“The acting is distinguished with rich performances from Ann Arvia and John G. Preston as the struggling and argumentative Van Daans, **an endearing Gus Cuddy as their son Peter**, and Michael Santo as Mr. Dussel, the grumpy dentist with an extreme dislike for the household cat.” [(Democrat & Chronicle)](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/lifestyle/2018/02/20/stirring-hendrickson-performance-brings-anne-frank-new-heights/353717002/)
