I really like the [Met](https://www.metmuseum.org/). I love their [open collection](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection), and I love their [API](https://metmuseum.github.io/). I wanted to build a simple app to explore the collection, and to learn more about the API.

This was also a great learning experience for me as it was the first app I built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). This is using the pre 1.0 version of SvelteKit.

It's a really fun way to explore images: I love the serendipity of the random images. I was greatly inspired by the newsletter of [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/), where he shares some fantastic artwork pulled form various open collections online.
