Saturdays are for [dreaming](/daydreaming).

I like to turn off the screens as much as possible. I turn my phone [on grayscale](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/technology/grayscale-phone.html).

Then I do other stuff.

Read books. Write in a journal. Go back to [the page](https://austinkleon.com/2017/11/15/paper-is-a-wonderful-technology/). Draw. Create something.

[Get outside](https://austinkleon.com/2017/02/16/get-out-now/). Breathe in fresh air. Take weird photos.

Make up plans. Scribble them out. Take stock.

Listen to some music. New music. Old music. Weird music.

Think about all the good things in the world. And think about all the terrible ones, too.

And the people and the birds and the trees and everything.

And then, after you've taken some time away, re-enter the matrix. (And when you do, don't forget to [vote](https://www.vote.org).)
