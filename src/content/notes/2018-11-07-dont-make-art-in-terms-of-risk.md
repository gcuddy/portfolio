Many people fetishize risk. Take chances! Take big risks! We're addicted to theatre and art that feels "risky".

Artists should, of course, take risks. But risk for risk's sake -- or, risks that are not properly thought through -- makes for boring art.

The best art, in all forms, take breathtaking risks. But to its creator, it is not a consciously derived risk. It is simply the way it had to be; it is personal expression, perhaps mixed with some bravado.

Beyonce is a perfect example of this. Her Coachella concert, for instance, was a stunning live show that reached deep into the unconscious with incredible force and clarity. There were "risks", but they were all completely bulletproof, completely thought through, completely _her_.

Great art does not simply "take risks" as if it's something you just decide to do to fulfill a quota. Instead, it makes bold choices with confidence and **clarity**.

Clarity doesn't mean that everything needs to be explained -- that would mean every David Lynch film would fall under the category of "pointless risk". Instead, clarity can be equated with a certain sense of rigor and confidence.

Lynch is just making art the only way he knows how, personal and weird and disturbing. He creates from the **unconscious**. But he is actually creating with immense clarity from the unconscious -- his decisions are rigorous -- which is why his films are so effective.

Thus, great art that "takes risks", is actually _accessing the unconscious regularly, and with great clarity._

We could even phrase it as a pithy formula, like: **Great Art = Unconscious + Clarity**.

If I consciously decide "I'm going to make risky art", I will be working from the conscious, and it will be patchwork.

The art you can make is the art only you can make. It's always you. **Make bold art from the unconscious, and strive for clarity and rigor**. The rest is kind of BS.
