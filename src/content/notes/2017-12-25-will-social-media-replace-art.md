I've been spending a lot of time on social media recently. (I'm taking a break till the end of the year, but that's another story.) It's kind of new to me, but I really like posting to my Instagram story. There's something satisfying in always having a little ring around your picture that indicates you are _doing_ something.

You are living your life and sharing it. Little funny things, or cool pictures, or selfies, or insights.

But lately, I can't shake this quote from an interview that playwright [Christopher Shinn][1] [gave a few months ago][2]:

> Social media - the ability to create and publish "art" from one's life, and consume "art" from one's circle - is going to further evolve and eventually overtake art as it exists today. My advice to writers starting out is, write as a hobby and choose something else as a career.

This seems cynical at first glance. But the more I interact with social media, the more I realize the truth in it.

We are beginning to turn our lives into continual performance art pieces, and social media is the document. In a culture of [fingers pointing at the moon][3], the fingers are _becoming_ the moon.

I don't have a good answer to this. I think it's plausible. I also think it means we need to make art -- especially of the analog variety -- with even greater clarity and intensity.

But the domination of social media is becoming overwhelming. It presents interesting opportunities: I like Twitter, and I like Instagram, and I like Snapchat. But it's also concerning, because the co-opting of the word "Stories" by Instagram and Snapchat indicates a shift into _narrative_. (Twitter's foray into narrative is through "Moments".) Narrativizing our lives can be a productive and sometimes dangerous thing psychologically, and an interesting project artistically. But it begs the question: as Social Media stories become more dynamic, more inclusive, more creative -- will there be a place for traditional artistic experiences outside of nostalgia?

It's worth chewing on, if only to clarify your own reason for choosing to make art.
