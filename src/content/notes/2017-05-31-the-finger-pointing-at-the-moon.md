We have a serious problem.

In an age of memes, podcasts, and reddit, we have approached a new age of meta-ness. Everything is ironic, reflexive, or post-something.

This, in itself, is not the problem. The problem is this: _the finger
pointing at the moon is not the moon._

What does this mean? It means don’t confuse the people talking about the art for the actual artist.

When it comes down to it, we need to go out and create the art. Do the work. Create the moon.

Instead, we have a generation once-removed.

We are obsessed with “life-hacking” everything: optimize your time. 10x
results by buying this software. Obsessed with the cult of productivity,
the cults of minimalism and organization.

But it’s all just fingers pointing at fingers pointing at the moon.

Get real, turn off the internet, and start working on the moon.
