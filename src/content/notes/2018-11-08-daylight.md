This is a very simple idea that I discovered courtesy of [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/2018/08/27/a-very-simple-rule/). It's helpful if you struggle with trying to do too many things, or get overwhelmed by work, or get sad in the evenings.

**Deal with problems in daylight.**

That's it. In general, after dinner, put the day away, and don't think about it too much. You did what you could. Let yourself relax, and go to sleep. Solve the problem in daylight, and with some fresh air. It's much better that way, and it makes you happier. (In my experience.)

As an actor, sometimes you are performing in the evening. But I try to make this the last thing I do: entering into another world. Before that I've put the day away, I've done what I could, and then after the performance, you de-compress and go to bed.

Daylight has a very special power. So does night time, but it's a different kind of power, and not one for solving problems and doing work. (But that's for another post.) So be sure to make use of daylight.
