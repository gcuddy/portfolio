title: Arc Browser Act 2 (concerns)
---

Not sure at all about the "Act 2" of [[Arc Browser]] as announced in [[thebrowsercompany2024_Meet Act II of Arc Browser  A browser that browses for you]].

- Live Folders could be interesting, but it does seem like we just keep re-inventing RSS, but with weirder proprietary systems. Because this is just RSS, right?
- Arc Explore / Search / Instant links thing - some pretty big red flags for me.
- Yes, searching for recipes and getting listicles and pages with lots of ads sucks. Everyone knows that. Google sucks. Capitalism sucks. The incentives are misdirected. That's why people try alternative search engines! Anyway, the answer to me is not to build "a new category of software" which is basically just doing a google search and then summarizing the first few web pages. The whole slick thing of "follow the money" and "we're pulling the internet into the future" doesn't add up. For one, the actual engineering of the core of Arc is still built on [[Chromium]] — instead of actually delivering competition to Google's iron grasp on the web. (I get that Chromium is open source, but it's still primarily a Google thing.) So the stuff about how bad Google is kind of rings false. Moreover, I *do not* trust LLMs to do the *very important* job of [[curation]], which is so much of what the internet has moved away from with [[the algorithmic feed]]. RSS, bookmarking, blogs, forums... they aren't perfect, we don't want just nostalgia, but I'm not convinced at all that a browser that "browses for you" is the way forward.
- It's funny - the AI making the web page thing reminds me of sort of a satanic twin to [[mmm.page]]. Trying to be whimsical but kind of... evil? Like it takes out all the joy of browsing the web, websites, information, etc. Idk, that's my initial reaction, could be completely wrong.
- Calling this a new category of software also just seems... goofy. Framing it as some historically revisionist march towards rebellious justice makes me cynical; feels like Obama-style false history-making. (weirdly there's prominently a Bernie sticker in the diner window behind Josh's head; what was the curious decision making behind leaving that in?)
- The most obvious rebuttal to the LLM search thing is the same as most all non-personal LLM things: what about attribution? What about copyright and credit? So the AI just steals a bunch of work and gives it to you? There's a major ethical gray area that they kind of seem willfully oblivious to? I don't understand.
- That being said — I have liked some of what Arc has done (though I've grown more weary of the sidebar as good UX). I'm just worried about the direction they're taking with putting all their chips on AI. Some of their initial ideas seemed more promising to me.
