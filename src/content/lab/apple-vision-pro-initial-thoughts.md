title: Crisis of Individualism (Apple Vision Pro)

Here are some initial thoughts on the [[Apple Vision Pro]], which launches today (February 2nd, 2024). I have not tried it yet — I'm just speculating.

Some of this is adapted from initial impressions when it was announced in June (2023-06-09):

- It's incredible the amount of effort we put into technology that does absolutely nothing for the betterment of humanity. Technology historically contains within it emanicpatory potential. The latest technological developments are not emancipatory, unless it's framed only from the cruel perpsective of liberating us from the ugliness of our own consciousness. There's some libidinal psychology here going on. As if Vision Pro is some image of the primordial father of a repressed unconscious. (cc [[Technology should be liberatory]])
- [[Marc Andreessen]] speaks of 'reality privelege' when he talks about the virtues of the metaverse. No matter how hard we try, we just can't seem to materially lift people out of poverty. We swear — there's just no solution, be pragmatic. The most practical thing is instead to give people reality distorting goggles that transport your sense of self and space/time and consciousness (see LM Sacasas on this mania)
- Reality Distortion: the [early reviews](https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price) point out the video passthrough on the Apple Vision Pro (AVP) is not perfect — it often has trouble with light. That's because when you strap on the AVP, Apple wants you to *not* enter a VR world like the Oculus, but to merely be able to spatially compute through your existing surroundings. But what you're seeing is a simulacrum — a projection of your world captured on camera and sped through to your eye senses at a high-speed refresh rate. This is a fascinating and philosophical technical decision (or limitation); like the shadows in Plato's cave.
- There's another lens to view Apple Vision Pro, which is under the guise of Tools for Thought and spatial computing. You'll notice that Apple, in their presentation, never uses the terms Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), or the Metaverse. Instead, they seek to "coin" the term Spatial Computing.
- No longer is computing confined to rectangular screens, our eyes all day struggling as they stare at two dimensions trying to unlock a third or even fourth. There are certainly compelling ideas here.
- Interestingly, [[Dynamicland]] and [[Folk Computer]] are also exploring a kind of Spatial Computing. But they do it through real physical objects: paper, blocks. Bret Victor famously ranted against the limitations of glass screens. While there is exploratory potential to augmenting your surroundings with computing, doing so on an individual level and waving your hands, manipulating *air*... hm.
- I haven't tried it yet, but how satisfying is it to type on an imaginary keyboard, your fingers wiggling through some limbic space-time continuum? Does it feel good to pick up the edge of a window, with no tactile feedback, and resize it?
- Apple Vision Pro is too expensive to worry much about its immediate impact, but I have worries that AVP will be like the Walkman for consciousness. It will actually lock ourselves into a cold individualism. The walkman turned music inwards, away from the communal, into the individualized ([[The Walkman marked the movement of music from external to internal 20220201220251]] . With music, this can certainly be a nice thing. But what about with your whole vision? Projects like Dynamicland and Folk Computer are built around collective computing experiences. People doing stuff together in space. With AVP, to quote the great Evan Hansen (haha), you're just "waving through a window".
- It seems awfully lonely in there.
