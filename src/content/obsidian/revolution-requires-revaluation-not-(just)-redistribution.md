Thinking here is that we must turn from valuing labor time to freedom.

Simply re-distributing wealth but maintaining capitalism and/or centrally valuing wage labor/profit is not enough. This is what social democrats do, what e.g. Sweden is, or what causes like [[universal basic income]] champion. But we will never actually be free under those conditions.
