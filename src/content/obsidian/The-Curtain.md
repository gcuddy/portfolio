# §The Curtain

[[Home]]

My newsletter.

When I think about my newsletter, I think there's really a few distinct parts:

* Writing (in terms of the essay)
* Curating Links (research)
* Editing

Going to try to think about my work in those distinct chunks from now on.

* Taglines & descriptions
  * Let's get smart about arts, media, culture, and technology. "The intersections of those and the future."
    * The intersections of those and the future.
      * obviously this isn't quite right but want to be clear that i'm referring to intersections of the above. and that you're getting SMARTER about the FUTURE

Workflow:

Curtain MOC, YYYY-MM-DD-001

With the 001 reflecting issue number

Script to create folder

That is sym-linked over to my website

Glob collection looks for issues -> 093/2021-03-02-093.md
Or index?
Something like that though...
