My general practice right now is heavily inspired by Rob Burbea's radical [[Imaginal Practice]]. Basically:

1. Cultivting [[samadhi]] through connecting and harmonizing with the energy body.
2. Working with emotions and loosening emotional blockages.
3. Allowing and generating "images" that increase soulfulness.

## Terms

* Samadhi - state of intense, joyful concentration (though that word doesn’t convey the fullness and richness of the Sanskrit).
  * [[samadhi (samādhi) is more than just concentration]]
  * [[Samadhi is about opening, not just sharpening]]
  * [[Samadhi should be pleasurable]]

- [[papañca]]
