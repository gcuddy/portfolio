Acting requires a direct channel to the [[unconscious]]. When I memorize a script, I implant the lines deep into my brain. My unconscious processes them while i sleep and daydream. When I perform, the performance moves *through* me. There is, of course, conscious effort involved â€” certainly in preparation, and of course in performing â€” but the conscious effort is a route to the unconscious (see: [[Conscious effort as a route to the unconscious, after Stanislavski]] and [[The acting computer, after Reed Birney 20220201112400]])

When i have a lot of lines, such as in [[â–² CONSTELLATIONS at Geva ðŸŒŒ]], I can't conceptualize the lines consciously. I can barely hear a line and know what's next. When I consciously think about it it seems impossible to do the play â€” how does my body know what happens? It seems incredibly large to hold in the conscious brain. And indeed it is. But we trust in the unconscious, and that's what moves through us on stage. I let the unconscious take over, the lines pour out, actions move through me, instincts take over, and we carve a path through the unknown.
