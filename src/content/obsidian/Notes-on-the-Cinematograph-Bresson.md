## Abstract 

The French film director Robert Bresson was one of the great artists of the twentieth century and among the most radical, original, and radiant stylists of any time. He worked with nonprofessional actors—models, as he called them—and deployed a starkly limited but hypnotic array of sounds and images to produce such classic works as _A Man Escaped_, _Pickpocket_, _Diary of a Country Priest_, and _Lancelot of the Lake_. From the beginning to the end of his career, Bresson dedicated himself to making movies in which nothing is superfluous and everything is always at stake.  
  
_Notes on the Cinematograph_ distills the essence of Bresson’s theory and practice as a filmmaker and artist. He discusses the fundamental differences between theater and film; parses the deep grammar of silence, music, and noise; and affirms the mysterious power of the image to unlock the human soul. This book, indispensable for admirers of this great director and for ­students of the cinema, will also prove an inspiration, much like Rilke’s _Letters to a Young Poet_, for anyone who responds to the claims of the imagination at its most searching and rigorous.

# Notes on the Cinematograph, Robert Bresson


# Introduction

L - 

[Location 51:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=51)
Year after year, Robert Bresson is asking the same questions. Questions about the actor and the model, about **the use of this immature art which others call cinema, and to which he tries to give the difficult name of cinematography** (the original magic of the Lumière brothers, when people were amazed to see the trees because “their leaves were moving”). 



### Location 55:

[[E - The creation of cinema is different than the creation of theatre]]
L - Cinema, as Robert Bresson insisted, needs to break itself free from the theatre; the creator of cinema is more—or at least different—than the director in theatre, because the creation of cinema is a perverse, metaphysical act: the attempt to create a world.

[Location 55:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=55)
The film-maker (**Bresson insists on the ==fundamental difference between the creator in cinematography and the metteur-en-scène, the director, still prisoner of concepts coming from the theatre and the stage==**) is not a ruler on some fake creation. He is a man, just a man, trying desperately, from all his heart, to expel and give shape to the feelings of his senses. A man, not a god, not an actor. 



### Location 61:

[Location 61:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=61)
**The model (a word Bresson prefers to the commonplace of “actor”) is exaltation, inspiration for the painter: “soul, body, inimitable.”** 



### Location 66:

[Location 66:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=66)
**To Bresson, art is the only possible escape from the bitterness of impotence**. But it is also much more. Its gives way to the only visible part of the being, its merging part. 



### Location 82:

[Location 82:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=82)
**In his hazardous, but rigorous quest, Robert Bresson teaches us the necessity of economy, and also the “voluptuousness” of creation**. Art is not in the mind. Art is in the eye, in the ear, in the memory of our senses. Images, dreams. Bresson’s desire for truth, through the exactitude of life. Yes, Mozart’s words about his own concertos—“They are brilliant . . . Yet, they lack poverty”—are significant here.

**Rid myself of the accumulated errors and untruths. Get to know my resources, make sure of them.** 



### Location 93:

[Location 93:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=93)
**The faculty of using my resources well diminishes when their number grows.** 



### Location 94:

[Location 94:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=94)
**Master precision. Be a precision instrument myself.**



### Location 95:

[Location 95:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=95)
Not have the soul of an executant (of my own projects). Find, for each shot, a new pungency over and above what I had imagined. **Invention (re-invention) on the spot**. 



### Location 97:

[Location 97:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=97)
Metteur-en-scène, director. **==The point is not to direct someone, but to direct oneself==**. 



### Location 98:

[Location 98:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=98)
**No actors.** (No directing of actors.) No parts. (No learning of parts.) No staging. But the use of working models, taken from life. ==**BEING (models) instead of SEEMING (actors).**== 



### Location 101:

[Location 101:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=101)
**Human Models: Movement from the exterior to the interior**. **(Actors: movement from the interior to the exterior.)** The thing that matters is not what they show me but what they hide from me and, above all, **what they do not suspect is in them**. 



### Location 106:

[Location 106:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=106)
==**Two types of film: those that employ the resources of the theatre (actors, direction, etc.) and use the camera in order to reproduce; those that employ the resources of cinematography and use the camera to create**==. 



### Location 109:

[Location 109:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=109)
==**CINEMATOGRAPHY[1] IS A WRITING WITH IMAGES IN MOVEMENT AND WITH SOUNDS.**== 



### Location 111:

[Location 111:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=111)
A film cannot be a stage show, because a stage show requires flesh-and-blood presence. But it can be, as photographed theatre or CINEMA is, the **photographic reproduction of a stage show**. 



### Location 113:

[Location 113:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=113)
But a photographic reproduction of Donatello’s Saint John the Baptist or of Vermeer’s Young Woman with Necklace has not the power, the value or the price of that sculpture or that painting. **It does not create it. Does not create anything.** 



### Location 117:

[Location 117:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=117)
An **actor in cinematography** might as well be in a foreign country. He **does not speak its language**. 



### Location 123:

[Location 123:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=123)
==**Nothing rings more false in a film than that natural tone of the theatre copying life and traced over studied sentiments.**==



### Location 130:

[Location 130:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=130)
Cinematographer’s film where expression is **obtained by relations of images and of sounds**, and not by a mimicry done with gestures and intonations of voice (whether actors’ or non-actors’). One that does not analyse or explain. That re-composes. 



### Location 133:

[Location 133:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=133)
**An image must be transformed by contact with other images as is a colour by contact with other colours.**



### Location 135:

[Location 135:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=135)
(What the cinematographer captures with his or her own resources cannot be what the theatre, the novel, painting capture with theirs). 



### Location 137:

[Location 137:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=137)
Cinematographer’s film where the images, like the words in a dictionary, have no power and value except through their position and relation. 



### Location 139:

[Location 139:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=139)
If an image, looked at by itself, expresses something sharply, if it involves an interpretation, it will not be transformed on contact with other images. The other images will have no power over it, and it will have no power over the other images. Neither action, nor reaction. It is definitive and unusable in the cinematographer’s system. 
**Note:** Fascinating idea 



### Location 143:

[Location 143:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=143)
Flatten my images (as if ironing them), without attenuating them. * 



### Location 148:

[Location 148:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=148)
The ejaculatory force of the eye. 



### Location 149:

[Location 149:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=149)
To set up a film is to bind persons to each other and to objects by looks. 



### Location 153:

[Location 153:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=153)
**My movie is born first in my head, dies on paper; is resuscitated by the living persons and real objects I use, which are killed on film but, placed in a certain order and projected on to a screen, come to life again like flowers in water**.[3] 



### Location 163:

[Location 163:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=163)
Radically suppress intentions in your models. 



### Location 164:

[Location 164:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=164)
To your models: “Don’t think what you’re saying, don’t think what you’re doing.” 



### Location 170:

[Location 170:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=170)
Not to use two violins when one is enough. 



### Location 171:

[Location 171:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=171)
Shooting. **Put oneself into a state of intense ignorance and curiosity, and yet see things in advance.** 



### Location 172:

[Location 172:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=172)
One recognizes the true by its efficacy, by its power. 



### Location 176:

[Location 176:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=176)
**Counter the high relief of theatre with the smoothness of cinematography.**



### Location 181:

[Location 181:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=181)
Cinematography, a military art. Prepare a film like a battle. 



### Location 185:

[Location 185:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=185)
In a mixture of true and false, the true brings out the false, the false hinders belief in the true. An actor simulating fear of shipwreck on the deck of a real ship battered by a real storm—we believe neither in the actor, nor in the ship nor in the storm. 



### Location 188:

[Location 188:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=188)
No music as accompaniment, support or reinforcement. No music at all. 



### Location 190:

[Location 190:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=190)
The noises must become music. 



### Location 192:

[Location 192:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=192)
Dig deep where you are. Don’t slip off elsewhere. Double, triple bottom to things. 



### Location 193:

[Location 193:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=193)
**Be sure of having used to the full all that is communicated by immobility and silence.**



### Location 194:

[Location 194:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=194)
Draw from your models the proof that they exist with their oddities and their enigmas. 



### Location 197:

[Location 197:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=197)
No absolute value in an image. Images and sounds will owe their value and their power solely to the use to which you destine them. 



### Location 206:

[Location 206:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=206)
Your film—let people feel the soul and the heart there, but let it be made like a work of hands. 



### Location 213:

[Location 213:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=213)
Let it be the intimate union of the images that charges them with emotion. 



### Location 214:

[Location 214:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=214)
Catch instants. Spontaneity, freshness. 



### Location 222:

[Location 222:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=222)
What no human eye is capable of catching, no pencil, brush, pen of pinning down, your camera catches without knowing what it is, and pins it down with a machine’s scrupulous indifference. 



### Location 230:

[Location 230:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=230)
Don’t run after poetry. It penetrates unaided through the joins (ellipses). 



### Location 240:

[Location 240:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=240)
Don’t let your backgrounds (avenues, squares, public gardens, subway) absorb the faces you are applying to them. 



### Location 241:

[Location 241:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=241)
Model. Thrown into the physical action, his voice, starting from even syllables, takes on automatically the inflexions and modulations proper to his true nature. 



### Location 250:

[Location 250:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=250)
Actors, costumes, sets and stage furniture are bound to make one think at once of the stage. Take care that the persons and objects in my film may not make people think at once of the cinematographer. 



### Location 254:

[Location 254:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=254)
Shooting. Stick exclusively to impressions, to sensations. No intervention of intelligence which is foreign to these impressions and sensations. 



### Location 261:

[Location 261:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=261)
If, on the screen, the mechanism disappears and the phrases you have made them say, the gestures you have made them make, have become one with your models, with your film, with you—then a miracle. 



### Location 264:

[Location 264:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=264)
Hide the ideas, but so that people find them. The most important will be the most hidden. 



### Location 279:

[Location 279:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=279)
Not to shoot a film in order to illustrate a thesis, or to display men and women confined to their external aspect, but to discover the matter they are made of. To attain that “heart of the heart” which does not let itself be caught either by poetry, or by philosophy, or by drama. 



### Location 289:

[Location 289:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=289)
Music takes up all the room and gives no increased value to the image to which it is added. * 



### Location 302:

[Location 302:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=302)
Things made more visible not by more light, but by the fresh angle at which I regard them. 



### Location 304:

[Location 304:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=304)
Bring together things that have as yet never been brought together and did not seem predisposed to be so. 



### Location 312:

[Location 312:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=312)
Noise of a door opening and shutting, noise of footsteps, etc., for the sake of rhythm. 



### Location 328:

[Location 328:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=328)
Dismantle and put together till one gets intensity. 



### Location 331:

[Location 331:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=331)
An actor coming from the theatre brings with him inevitably its conventions, its morality and some duties towards his art.

An old thing becomes new if you detach it from what usually surrounds it.

All those effects you can get from repetition (of an image, of a sound). 



### Location 358:

[Location 358:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=358)
Your film must resemble what you see on shutting your eyes. (You must be capable, at any instant, of seeing and hearing it entire.) 



### Location 368:

[Location 368:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=368)
Image and sound must not support each other, but must work each in turn through a sort of relay.

To be constantly changing lenses in photographing is like constantly changing one’s glasses. *

Theatre and CINEMA: alternation of believing and not believing. Cinematography: continually believing.

Gestures and words cannot form the substance of a film as they form the substance of a stage play. But the substance of a film can be that . . . thing or those things which provoke the gestures and words and which are produced in some obscure way in your models.

**Note:** And vice versa 



### Location 457:

[Location 457:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=457)
With the centuries, the theatre has bourgeoisified. The CINEMA (photographed theatre) shows how far. 



### Location 475:

[Location 475:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=475)
The true is not encrusted in the living persons and real objects you use. It is an air of truth that their images take on when you set them together in a certain order. Vice versa, the air of truth their images take on when you set them together in a certain order confers on these persons and objects a reality. * 
**Note:** I wonder how Godard would respond to this? The two seem at times in congruence with each other, and at times not. 



### Location 478:

[Location 478:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=478)
To put sentiments on his face and into his gestures is the art of the actor, is theatre. Not to put sentiments on his face and into his gestures is (still) not cinematography. Involuntarily expressive models (not wilfully inexpressive ones). * 



### Location 480:

[Location 480:](kindle://book/?action=open&asin=B01BRFN8QE&location=480)
The eye (in general) superficial, the ear profound and inventive. A locomotive’s whistle imprints in us a whole railroad station.

Music. It isolates your film from the life of your film (musical delectation). It is a powerful modifier and even destroyer of the real, like alcohol or dope.

Do not use the same models in two films. (1) One would not believe in them. (2) They would look at themselves in the first film as one looks at oneself in the mirror, would want people to see them as they wish to be seen, would impose a discipline on themselves, would grow disenchanted as they corrected themselves.

Obvious travelling or panning shots do not correspond to the movements of the eye. This is to separate the eye from the body. (One should not use the camera as if it were a broom). 
**Note:** Disagree with this. What about treating the camera as something entirely new - a new way of seeing?

Put your models through reading exercises, designed to equalize the syllables and to do away with an intentional personal effect. The script made uniform and regular.

Leonardo recommends (Notebooks) thinking hard of the end, thinking first and foremost of the end. The end is the screen, which is only a surface. Submit your film to the reality of the screen, as a painter submits his picture to the reality of the canvas itself and of the colours applied on it, the sculptor his figures to the reality of the marble or the bronze.

Proust says that Dostoyevsky is original in composition above all. It is an extraordinarily complex and close-meshed whole, purely inward, with currents and counter-currents like those of the sea, a thing that is found also in Proust (in other ways so different) and whose equivalent would go well with a film.
