Would just create *instructions* for his conceptual artwork wall drawings

In some ways precursor to generative art â€” somewhat random and interpretative

Exercise:

* Take his directions and re-implement them

Implementing his instructions in [[Javascript]]: https://solvingsol.com/

kind of cool...

Solomon "Sol" LeWitt (September 9, 1928 â€“ April 8, 2007) was an American artist linked to various movements, including conceptual art and minimalism.[1]

LeWitt came to fame in the late 1960s with his wall drawings and "structures" (a term he preferred instead of "sculptures") but was prolific in a wide range of media including drawing, printmaking, photography, painting, installation, and artist's books. He has been the subject of hundreds of solo exhibitions in museums and galleries around the world since 1965. The first biography of the artist, Sol LeWitt: A Life of Ideas, by Lary Bloom, was published by Wesleyan University Press in the spring of 2019.[2]
