## The mixtape was a means of asynchronous emotional communication

Before cell phones and the internet, the analog mixtape was a form of long-distance, asynchronous communication — but one of a particular variety. It enabled communication through music, which meant communication through a form of abstract emotions.

The physical nature of the mixtape — it being passed back and forth, no instant contact — is very important. But digital playlists do have some sort of effect — [[Playlists feel like a paean against algorithmic culture]].
