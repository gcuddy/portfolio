At its core, a computer is a glowing rectangle.

Within that rectangle, there are many worlds.

But those worlds are other rectangles.

In the instance of the web browser, a web browser is a rectangle inside a bigger "hardware" rectangle. Often, we use web "apps" that are trapped inside this rectangle.

A web app might spring a pop-up modal â€” this too is a rectangle, inside a rectangle, inside a rectangle...

It's rectangles all the way down.
