Shamans are an individual interacting with some sort of spirit world through altered states of consciousness, generally for the purpose of healing.

Shamanic individuals were pervasive through {hunter-gatherer societies}, to the point that they've become an {archetypal figure} (Yoda, etc).

Shamans would provide health care, reduce discord, and enhance hunting.

It's plausible that {shamanism} helps explain the sudden explosion in cognition in the {[[Upper Paleolithic transition]]} (John Vervaeke, [[Awakening from the Meaning Crisis]]).
