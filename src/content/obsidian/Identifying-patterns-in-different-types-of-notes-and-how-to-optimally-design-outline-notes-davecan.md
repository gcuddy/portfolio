I'm doing a top-to-bottom review of my notes for the next few days and am already identifying that I tend to create the following types of notes in my ZK:

- Collection-oriented notes (index/outline/hub notes, "topic cluster" notes, "List of ..." notes, and MOCs)
- Definition notes (often used to capture definitions from different authors)
- Differentiation notes
- Concept-oriented notes
- Principle-oriented notes
- Executable strategy notes

The last three are the ones I'm particularly interested in. (the collection set is a bit messy and less well-defined, probably needs some cleanup)

Actual example note titles for each:

- Definition: `def. Civic Society (Putnam)`
- Differentiation: `Comparison of unicast, multicast, and broadcast`
- Concept: `Teach me, coach me, watch me`
- Principle: `A well-defined security architecture enables a structured and consistent security posture`
- Executable Strategy: `How to efficiently read a book and maximize knowledge extraction`

For Definition and Differentiation notes I titled them as shown above so they are easy to distinguish.

Does anyone else find that you create these types of notes? Do you clearly distinguish between them as "types" and if so, how?

I'm considering two options for the last three "types" of notes:

- Tag them as `#Concept`, `#Principle`, or `#ExecutableStrategy` (I don't like using tags for the first two, but perhaps I'm wrong)
- Add them to structured outlines

I'm generally preferring the outline approach, but that begs the question _how to optimally design an outline note_ to help manage this?

My "collection" notes above are all gradually converging on a structured outline approach, but there tends to be a lot of overlap between them. It's honestly the same problem as tag proliferation: overlapping tags are replaced with overlapping outlines.

So it seems the issue is how to properly define outlines such that they take the above note types into account, and how to define them so each outline is clearly distinct and distinguishable from other (possibly related) outlines.

This may involve changing the way I title the outlines, which currently are noun-based e.g. `Security fundamentals` or `Note-taking systems` etc.

Appreciate any insight on solving this growing problem.

Notes

- hub notes: tighter hubs and broader hubs

> I use `✧` prefix to denote a more tightly focused hub note, and `✨` prefix to denote a broad hub note that may link to many more focused hub notes. For example, on the right is `✨ Signals`. The reason this is denoted as a "higher level" (so to speak) hub note is because signals are used in various ways, and I have notes on them (external to the ZK, slowly being absorbed in) including computer networking (wired and wireless) and digital signal processing. ^rnch85

I could use this for Internet, vs sub sections of internet for example

> - a hub note `✧ Electronics` (if useful) that would be similar to the above but focus on that topic
