## Emergent note structure

> MOCs and index notes (etc) only replicate folder structures when they are defined top-down in that fashion.
> 
> But they can be incredibly useful when you allow them to emerge from the bottom up.
> 
> For example, the MOC approaches you see that use some form of decimal system to establish structures as a framework to _start_ with are well-intentioned but flawed, IMO.
> 
> A better approach is to just start with notes and then identify themes and collections organically from the bottom up, collect _those_ into notes, and then eventually label them MOCs or whatever else you want.
> 
> In my own note collection I have multiple “levels” of “hierarchy” without imposing a hierarchy at all. (its more of a heterarchy, because I can freely put any note in any list anywhere at any time)
> 
> 1.  Notes - lowest level
> 2.  Outlines/Lists - ordered or unordered collections of notes on a very specific theme
> 3.  Topic Clusters - ordered or unordered collections (including list notes) on a broader theme
> 4.  A handful of MOCs - top level broad collections
> 
> Notes from higher levels can freely link to any of the notes in the lower levels.
> 
> Actual example from my own notes:
> 
> 1.  Individual notes on note taking methods, principles, ideas, etc
> 2.  Two list notes: `List of note taking principles` and `List of note taking methods` collecting the notes from #1 in various ways
> 3.  Topic clusters: one on Zettelkasten method, one on note taking systems in general, etc, each linking to items from #1 and #2 as appropriate
> 4.  A few MOCs: I don’t have a “note taking MOC” but I do have one titled `Reasoning and Learning MOC` which includes a section on knowledge digestion and note making, containing links to various items from #1 - #3 as appropriate
> 
> In this manner a broad grouping of topics has emerged from my notes, with no central planning. MOCs are a useful concept for collecting these together, without requiring me to pre-define a central taxonomy. The MOCs in my collection are analogous to academic disciplines or fields of study in a sense but are unique and specific to my needs and interests.

In the note title you will notice the suffix `(E.2102150921)` which denotes it as an evergreen note of my own thinking.

In the reference section at the end of the note is a link to another note with the suffix `(L.2102150922)` which denotes it as a literature note capturing a single concept from a single source.

Here’s what that note looks like:

==Notice the source link at the bottom. Literature notes in my system by definition have a single source, not a “sources” or “references” section.==

That source note (with the `S...` suffix) in turn looks like this: (zoomed out a bit to be more visible in the screenshot)

These “source notes” are where I take my rough notes from a source, then compile them together and turn them into those individual literature notes capturing specific concepts. (yes this is a different use of the term “literature note” than many people)

Here’s an example of a source note that is partially complete, for Wozniak’s _20 rules of knowledge formulation_:

As I (gradually – incremental reading!) process the source I extract information and chunk it together into those phrase-titled literature notes, each tied back to their source.

I will admit I’m not 100% happy with the `L.` and `E.` distinction because the line between them gets _very blurry_ fairly often. Creating this distinction really helped me when I was dealing with a rapid explosion of my notes in the early days but now I’m starting to question the utility. It may be that I convert most/all of my `L.` notes to `E.` notes in the near future. TBD.

[@kdnavrat](https://forum.obsidian.md/u/kdnavrat) Note that I did **NOT** start out like this. My system was a _mess_ at first because I was frantically thrashing around trying a wide variety of things. Because of that I recommend newcomers start simple and focus on principles over mechanics, and solve the problems that come up when they come up.

I have a _lot_ of junk floating around in my notes that I periodically work on cleaning up.

The good news I suppose is that I have a _**LOT**_ of info on good and bad note taking principles now lol. A lot of it from failed experiments.

[@mambocab](https://forum.obsidian.md/u/mambocab) I’ve done the same kinds of experimentation! I’ve used emoji and unicode for file name prefixes, at one point I was using tree emoji as a prefix then I made it a tag and then I abandoned it. I then decided to use a lightbulb emoji as a prefix (for some weird reason) and then abandoned it but had weird leftover files with it randomly scattered around. Now I’m resurrecting the emoji not as a file name prefix but to denote insights _within notes_ which seems to work well.

As you said it gets difficult when trying to keep things straight because concepts can get so overlapped once you have enough notes. I do think a classification method of some kind is useful but more as a mental model to guide behavior than as something explicit in the note system itself

## devonthink

I have an existing corpus of about 25 million words across some 6,000 files (much of it dealing with regulations and processes) which is carefully categorized in DevonTHINK. Most of them are PDFs and DT Pro has powerful OCR and rapid search capabilities which make finding information in those documents nearly trivial.

I use Obsidian as a Zettelkasten and occasionally pull an item from my DT database for extraction into ZK notes. When I do that I reference the x-callback-url for the DT file in the note.

Basically files in DT can (when needed) become sources in my existing source processing workflow.
