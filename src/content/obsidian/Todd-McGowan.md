First heard McGowan recommended by [[Robin Sloan]] for [this podcast](https://aufhebungabunga.podbean.com/e/167-the-kingdom-of-god-is-in-main-street-ft-todd-mcgowan/), namely this line:

> I think ==**politics is a struggle over the distribution of enjoyment**==.

And:

> I really would push against this idea that politics is about how power is distributed in society. I think it’s much more about how enjoyment is distributed in society.
