# Daily Notes

A daily note practice is great for many people. Try it out. Just never feel obligated to make a daily note every day. But do use them. They are great for a mixture of uses, such as:

* planning your day
* jotting down ideas
* taking meeting notes
* reflecting on your day

The only things I have found I care to log consistently I have given tags:

* #log/event
* #log/journal
* #log/meeting
* #log/tutoring
* #log/meditation
* #log/reading
* #log/workout
* #log/writing

While I prefer to click on the Calendar (over in the upper right usually), below is a simple view of the latest daily notesâ€”including a few from the future:

```dataview
list
from "Journal" and -#on/readme
sort file.name desc
```
