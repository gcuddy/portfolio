# Meet Act II of Arc Browser | A browser that browses for you

## Video

 ![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIeJF3kL5ng)

## Description
On Thursday, February 1st @ 12.30pm ET we shared our vision for Act II of this journey we call Arc — a new category of software, a browser that browses for you.

We also introduced 4 new upcoming features that hint at our Act II:

02:00 Instant Links — Available Today
05:00 Arc Explore — Coming Soon
09:10 Arc Search (with Browse for Me) — Available Today in the app store
10:58  Live Folder Beta — Available Feb 15

Tell us what Live Folder integrations we should build first!? ➡️ https://browserco.typeform.com/to/QIEbRio1

We couldn’t be more excited about what’s ahead. 

And, above all, thank you. Because we wouldn’t be here without you.
