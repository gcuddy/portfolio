#2022/10/30 Very interested how this "tech optimism" dovetails with what actually happened in the 2000s and critiques of technology (i.e. [[Computers transformed the way we interact with the world, but didn't improve physical infrastructure or material conditions (E.202210280021)]] which echoes [[graeber2012 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit]])
Today we don't have much tech optimism â€” is this a problem? What about what Wang says in [[Definite Optimism as Human Capital  Dan Wang]]

via aesthetics wiki:

> **Y2K**Â (also known asÂ **Cyber Y2K**,Â **Futuristic Y2K**, orÂ **Kaybug**) is an aesthetic that was prevalent in popular culture from roughly 1997 to 2004. Named after theÂ [Y2K Bug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem "wikipedia:Year 2000 problem"), it is characterized by a distinct aesthetic period, encapsulating fashion, hardware design, music, and furnishings ==shining with tech optimism== â€” sometimes literally. Some of its aspects include tight leather pants, shiny clothing, silver eyeshadow, spiky updos, Oakleys, gradients, translucence, and Blobitecture. Most Y2K aesthetics rely on the use of technology and slick futuristic looks, signaling the optimism of a new era as the 20th century/2nd millennium progressed into the 21st Century/3rd Millennium. The Y2K era ended around the end of 2004 and was succeeded by theÂ [Frutiger Aero](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Frutiger_Aero "Frutiger Aero")Â andÂ [McBling](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/McBling "McBling")Â era.
> 
> Y2K aesthetics are mostly classified as a subcategory of another futuristic aesthetic,Â [Retro-Futurism](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Retro-Futurism "Retro-Futurism"). Some elements of Y2K also cross over withÂ [Vaporwave](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Vaporwave "Vaporwave"), another Retro-Futurist aesthetic, since it shares Vaporwave's angst towards late-stage capitalism, and its nostalgia for a future that never came. However, the Y2K aesthetic has not yet been explored by the Vaporwave scene as much as earlier, more ubiquitous periods, such as the '80s/early '90s neon aesthetics likeÂ [Memphis](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Memphis "Memphis")Â andÂ [Synthwave](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Synthwave "Synthwave").
