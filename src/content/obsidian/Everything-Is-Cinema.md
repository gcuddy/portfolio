## Highlights
- Even now, Breathless feels like a high-energy fusion of jazz and philosophy. After Breathless, most other new films seemed instantly old-fashioned. The triumph of Godard’s longtime friend François Truffaut at the 1959 Cannes festival with The 400 Blows, had announced to the world the cinematic sea change effected by a group of critics-turned-filmmakers already known in France by the journalistic label of la nouvelle vague, the New Wave. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=154))
- More than any other event of its time, Breathless inspired other directors to make films in a new way and sparked young people’s desire to make films. It instantly launched cinema as the ==primary art form== of a new generation. ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=161))
- the ==underlying promise of the [[French New Wave]]—to turn movies into an art form as sophisticated and as intellectually powerful as literature or painting==— ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=182))
- Indeed, for Godard, the cinema is the art of arts, ==encompassing and channeling the full spectrum of what is human, from the broadest political currents and the other art forms to the most intimate reaches of his own life==. ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=192))
- As Godard told me, “Everything is cinema.” ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=192))
- IF EVERYTHING IS CINEMA , then approaching Godard’s vast work in any meaningful way necessarily means being prepared to deal with everything: politics, art, philosophy, history, nature, beauty, lust, torment, money, love, and the random element. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=226))
- Casually, and without any theoretical fuss, he treated films as something more than creations that bore the mark of their makers; he considered them inseparable from the lives of their creators. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=248))
- “At the cinema, we do not think, we are thought. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=278))
- The ideas that they sketch are the unity of the filmmaker with the film, the inseparability of both from the social world at large, the credence of a devout moviegoer in the reality of the world as presented in the cinema, and the aesthetic fecundity of this fanatical submission. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=285))
- The viewer who was “thought” at the cinema was Godard himself; the filmmaker who was one with his film would be Godard himself; and his films would be the seemingly infinite variations on the theme of his singular faith in the cinema and in its ability to preserve and to reflect both the reality of the filmmaker and of his times through the intersection of personal stories and political history. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=287))
- THE STORY OF Jean-Luc Godard’s work is one of a conversion to the secular religion of art and, specifically, to the art of cinema. For this art form, for this sort of passion, the holy city was, and remains, Paris. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=295))
- The movies started in France, with the work of the Lumière brothers,3 and the special relationship of Paris to the movies is in large part due to that city’s central role in French civilization. For France, Paris is three things in one: it is the country’s New York, Washington, D.C., and Hollywood—the cultural, political, and cinematic capital. The three domains are much more strongly interconnected in France than in the United States, and activity in any one of the three fields is quickly reflected in the other two. As a result, in France the movie business has also been, all along, both a strain of high art and a sensitive political barometer. ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=297))
- For France, Paris is three things in one: it is the country’s New York, Washington, D.C., and Hollywood—the cultural, political, and cinematic capital. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=299))
- French filmmakers participated in, and often emerged from, literary circles, and Parisian artists took a serious interest in the movies almost from their inception. ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=303))
- It was the French critic Ricciotto Canudo who called the cinema the “sixth art” in a 1911 essay (and the “seventh art” in 1919). Charlie Chaplin and D. W. Griffith were French cultural heroes as early as 1916, and artists of all sorts, especially the surrealists, took the cinema very seriously. Jean Cocteau made a film in 1930; Salvador Dali collaborated with Luis Buñuel on Un Chien andalou and L’Age d’or; the film director Sacha Guitry was first a famous playwright; the greatest French prewar filmmaker, Jean Renoir, who made his first film in 1925, was the son of Auguste Renoir, the artist. Unlike American writers, for whom working on movies usually meant going to Hollywood and setting literature aside, such French writers as Cocteau, Jean-Paul Sartre, André Malraux, Jean Giraudoux, and Jacques Prévert were active in the cinema without having to distance themselves, geographically or practically, from the literary scene. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=304))
- Reading aloud from literature was a common form of domestic entertainment and ritual. Godard’s grandfather, Julien Monod, enforced humanistic rules, including the requirement that youngsters recite literature at the dinner table. Each year, on his maternal grandparents’ wedding anniversary, young Jean-Luc was expected to recite Valéry’s poem “Le Cimetière marin” (The Seaside Cemetery).7 (Moreover, Godard recalled receiving Latin lessons from Valéry.)8 Religion was part of the family’s cultural heritage as well, and Godard recalled attending Protestant “temple” regularly though without doctrinaire devotion: he considered it a casual habit (“I went, the same way I played soccer or did gymnastics”)9 and, with his grandfather Monod, debated the minister’s sermons. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=335))
- His family was ready to pay for him to study art, but he decided against it; he applied for admission to the most prominent Paris film school, IDHEC (Institut des Hautes Etudes Cinétographiques), but was rejected.21 He watched movies instead, and frequented the most important place to see them in postwar Paris, a museum-like facility called the Cinéthèque. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=399))
- After the Liberation, Langlois’s public screenings quickly became a focal point for film enthusiasts and artistic luminaries, including Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Georges Braque, and André Breton. At his screening room on the avenue de Messine, they rediscovered films that had been rendered invisible by the war’s restrictions, along with classics, familiar and hidden, old and new, from world cinema. In order to show the films while circumventing France’s regulations concerning taxation and censorship (then, as now, films released in France were submitted to a review board for a “visa de contrôle”), Langlois—who also collected diverse forms of movie memorabilia, from classic posters to famous costumes—declared his collection the Musée du cinéma (Museum of Cinema), which offered its screenings to museum visitors for a trivial surcharge added to its admission fee. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=417))
- As a collector, Langlois was an omnivore; as a curator, he was a critic of genius; as a film lover, he was a visionary. He was not at all modest about his intentions: he wanted his Cinéthèque to be “a sort of center where people come as they are and then leave different.”22 He offered his habitués a history of cinema based less on chronology than on thematic connections between films. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=424))
- Yet his screenings were Langlois’s most important contribution to the creation of a future cinema. They offered young people a comprehensive overview of the cinema to date and oriented that history in terms of his own refined aesthetic taste; and Godard was one of the assiduous young habitués of the Cinéthèque whose enthusiasms Langlois cultivated. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=434))
- THE POSTWAR PARIS in which Godard came of intellectual age was dominated by the influence of one thinker, Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980). During the war, Sartre had written a philosophical treatise, L’Etre et le néant (Being and Nothingness), published in 1943, in which he displayed his newfound absorption in the work of Martin Heidegger. There, Sartre sought to define human existence in terms of history—though not, as Heidegger did, abstractly, but in terms of the specifics of social life and the practicalities of political action. Though this massive tome brought Sartre a quiet renown in academic circles, his wartime experience as a playwright, a screenwriter, a journalist, and an organizer of a resistance group led him to consider how he, as a writer, could play a role in the history of his times. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=437))
- Sartre later described his impression of the opportunity that the Liberation offered: “At that moment, as a way of adapting to what was taking place, I conceived the idea of a total public, something that no previous writer could ever have had. The writer could have a total public if he said to the total public what the total public itself thought, albeit not so well.” ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=444))
- in order to become the defining thinker of his era, Sartre knew that he would need to become famous— ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=448))
- On October 29, 1945, Sartre gave a lecture sponsored by Club Maintenant (The Now Club) titled “Existentialism Is a Humanism.” The event had been widely advertised; the hall was filled to capacity with a clamorous, at times rowdy, crowd; the speech was a raucous, much-reported success, and the printed text became an instant bestseller. As if overnight, in a success that almost a decade of philosophical and literary effort had prepared, Sartre became a celebrity and then an icon. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=460))
- But Sartre, during the war, had cast his lot with the left, and now was, in effect, reprocessing Heidegger’s ideas in order to claim them for the left—and, at the same time, offering a new generation of leftists an avant-garde philosophy that seemed more exciting than another gloss on Marx. ([Location 472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=472))
- Sartre intended the “engagement” of a writer to signify the obligation to take sides, to convert writing into action—specifically, into a form of political action as defined by the one particular type of political commitment that was implied by Sartre’s philosophy—on the far left. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=479))
- THE INFLUX OF American films quickly became a contested issue in postwar France. The “deserted and famished Paris” that Sartre described on August 20, 1945,24 turned its eyes beseechingly to the last best hope for economic relief, the United States. ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=483))
- Bazin’s theoretical writings, which were launched in 1945 with the essay “The Ontology of the Photographic Image,” revolved around his conception of the relation of image to reality—as he conceived it. He argued that, in photography, “an image of the world is formed automatically, without the creative intervention of man. The personality of the photographer enters into the proceedings only in his selection of the object to be photographed and by way of the purpose he has in mind.” He claimed that photography “affects us like a phenomenon in nature”—and defined the cinema as “objectivity in time.” ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=544))
- Before Bazin, leading film theorists (most crucially, Sergei Eisenstein) had argued that the essence of cinema was the editing of film, the sequential ordering of different images in order to generate mental effects in the viewer. ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=549))
- It is hard to imagine, however, that a critic who advocated the filmmaker’s nonintervention and the effacement of the filmmaker’s personality in favor of the “automatic” working of the camera could be much of an inspiration to fiery young aspiring artists. ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=555))
- MAURICE SCHÉRER, BORN in 1920, was a high school teacher, a novelist, and a film enthusiast who, in a trio of articles (one in La Revue du cinéma in 1948 and two in Les Temps modernes in 1948 and 1949), attempted to formulate an ambitious and comprehensive theoretical definition of the cinema that differed radically from Bazin’s. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=559))
- In the first article, “Cinema, the Art of Space,” Schérer rejected Bazin’s emphasis on the representation of three-dimensional space within an image. Instead, Schérer argued that objects within that space, especially the “objects” known as actors, generated increased “meaning” from the way that a director placed them in space by means of film editing: “Movements and gestures whose meaning seemed contingent are in a sense—by their insertion into a certain spatial universe—grounded in necessity.” ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=562))
- In his writings, Schérer explained the aesthetic virtues of a range of films neglected by Bazin, including those of Buster Keaton, many German “expressionist” films (especially F. W. Murnau’s), and such recent American productions as the films of Preston Sturges, Jean Renoir (who had been active in Hollywood during and after the war), and, especially, Alfred Hitchcock (who, Bazin wrote in 1950, had “taken us in”). ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=576))
- Schérer’s writings, with their emphasis on the speech and gestures of actors, foretold the films that he would make under that pseudonym—Eric Rohmer. ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=584))
- AT THE CCQL and the Cinémathèque, Godard met another young regular at the screenings, François Truffaut. Born in 1932, Truffaut had dropped out of school at age fourteen, in 1946, in order to devote his time to watching films. ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=586))
- From January to March 1949, Truffaut was confined in a juvenile detention center; a psychologist’s consultation with André Bazin proved decisive in his release. Bazin vouched for Truffaut and, upon his release, hired him at Work and Culture as his personal secretary. ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=597))
- When Langlois’s screening room was full, the young men watched the films lying flat on their backs on the floor in front of the first row. ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=610))
- Like Rivette and Truffaut, Godard virtually lived at the movies, though usually did not participate in the public discussions. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=611))
- The Cinémathèque, the CCQL, Work and Culture, and other film clubs and movie theaters were Godard’s constant haunts, and Truffaut and Rivette became his constant companions there. It was standard practice for them to see three or four films per day, or to spend the entire day in a single theater. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=614)) ^493817
- Because films at the Cinémathèque often finished very late, after the métro’s service ended for the night—according to Truffaut, Langlois was simply indifferent to such practicalities—the young enthusiasts, who could not afford a taxi, walked together through the night, talking about what they had seen. ([Location 619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=619))
- Their obsession, in terms of quantity of knowledge and depth of understanding of the cinema, would leave its mark in the criticism, and ultimately the films, of these young enthusiasts. ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=622))
- La Gazette was an outlet for Rohmer’s own writings (the first issue featured his “Technical Study of ‘Rope,’” the film by Alfred Hitchcock, on the front page), and also featured the work of his young acolytes; the second issue, of June 1950, featured Godard’s notes on Joseph Mankiewicz, as well as an essay by Rivette about Jean Renoir’s The Southerner. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=628))
- Yet Godard and his friends were not planning to be professional film critics; they planned to make films, and they were not alone in their desire to do so. Literary Paris had a passion for the cinema. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=631))
- In “Birth of a New Avant-Garde,” published in L’Ecran français of March 30, 1948, the novelist and journalist Alexandre Astruc, who also made 16mm films, prophesied the era of the “Caméra stylo,” the “camera-pen” with which “an artist can express his thought, as abstract as it may be, or can translate his obsessions exactly as is done today with the essay or the novel.” ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=641))
- Astruc, who had a hand in planning La Gazette du cinéma (his “Notes on Film Direction” appeared on the front page of the first issue), argued that the cinema had already revolutionized intellectual history: “Today a Descartes would lock himself in his room with a 16mm camera and film and would write on film the discourse on method [sic].” ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=644))
- Godard exemplified the philosophical filmmaker of Astruc’s fantasy. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=647))
- Godard himself later recalled, “I had encyclopedic tendencies. I wanted to read everything. I wanted to know everything. Existentialism was at its peak at that time. Through Sartre I discovered literature, and he led me to everything else.”50 ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=652))
- Jean Douchet remembered him reading two books a day, but Truffaut described Godard’s literary bulimia differently: “He would go to people’s apartments and look at the first and last page of every book on the shelf.”51 Godard’s approach to literature was perfect for a future filmmaker, inasmuch as it extracted from books the broadest story outlines and grandly aphoristic phrases, but, in its indifference to the intricacies of plot and fine points of character, it was antithetical to literary craftsmanship—as Godard quickly discovered. ([Location 654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=654))
- In thrall to the cinema, and unquestioningly accepting the reality that it presented, Godard saw his attempts at literary representation trumped definitively by the power of the camera—and yet, his primordial dreams would ultimately reveal themselves in a cinema haunted by the primal, originary force of literature. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=664))
- Isou (who died in 2007) thought that his movement, Lettrism, went further into authentic avant-gardism than did Dadaism or surrealism, inasmuch as he sought not merely to break up the meaning of sentences, but to break up words into letters, mere phonic elements, preferably of a primal violence: his performances and writings consisted of atavistic onomatopoieic eructations. ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=698))
- despite their intellectual sophistication, they were condemned to anonymity, obscurity, marginality, unless they found a radical way to break into the French film industry, unless they found a way to attract attention. ([Location 762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=762))
- Their method—the one that Godard himself undertook, at age nine-teen—was criticism. It was a singular method, which served two purposes, revolutionary and didactic. Godard and his young film-lover friends were learning how to make films by watching films; they were giving themselves a conservatory education at the Cinémathèque and the CCQL. By writing about the films they saw, they did two things: they elaborated and refined their ideas about the cinema, in anticipation of the day when they could make films; and they created for themselves a public identity that would get them the chance to make films. ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=764))
    - Note: Consume and create
- Godard and his friends used this magazine, Cahiers du cinéma, as a base from which to launch their assault on the citadel of the French cinema. In the process, they changed the way that the French, and indeed the world, thought about movies, and helped to set in motion a generational shift that resounded far beyond their field of artistic endeavor. ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=774))
- For the time being, Godard’s activities would not involve making movies; instead, they were centered around watching movies and writing about them for Cahiers du cinéma, and Cahiers itself was centered around André Bazin. ([Location 855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=855))
- BAZIN THE ORGANIZER and Bazin the critic were, in effect, two different men. As a critic, he relentlessly pushed an idea that he developed into a doctrine, hardened to a dogma, and uttered as a prejudice. Yet as an organizer of ciné-clubs, he united lovers of movies and tirelessly proselytized for the cinema as such, and did so with extraordinary openness, tolerance, and generosity. At Cahiers du cinéma, Bazin did both: he continued to argue for his own theoretical notions, but he also gathered around him enthusiasts who disagreed with him—mainly Rohmer and the young men from the CCQL—and none did so more bluntly or brilliantly than Godard. ([Location 857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=857))
- In March 1952, Cahiers included Godard’s review of Alfred Hitchcock’s Strangers on a Train, the first endorsement in the magazine of the director whom the CCQL habitués considered the exemplary artist of Hollywood’s industrial system of film production—and Cahiers published it despite Bazin’s distaste for Hitchcock’s films. ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=863))
- Godard challenged that notion head-on. Praising Otto Preminger and other American directors for their use of shot-reverse shot, he specifically locates in “that spatial discontinuity due to a change of shot, which certain enthusiasts of the ‘ten-minute take’”—meaning Bazin—“feel obligated to disdain, the reason for the greater part of truth which this figure of style contains.” Godard was claiming that spatial discontinuity itself generated a sense of “psychological reality, meaning that of the emotions.” He argued that visual elements resulting from shot-reverse shot, such as the isolation of characters in the frame or the change in visual perspective, reflected the characters’ differing mental points of view, their inner life. His prime example for his argument is the work of a director whom Godard referred to as “the greatest American artist—I mean Howard Hawks”—another Hollywood filmmaker whose films Bazin neglected. ([Location 874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=874))
- And the specific emotional life, the supercharged sentimentality, that Godard found exemplified in American melodramas, was not something that Godard apologized for as a base, kitschy, or guilty pleasure: on the contrary, he defended it as an attribute of high art and called attention to what he considered its latent philosophical import: “Do not smile at such passion inflamed by logic, one surely feels that what ensures its worth is that at each instant it is a matter of loving or dying.” ([Location 883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=883))
- For Godard, paradoxically, this classicizing approach, as exemplified in such Hollywood films as the harsh melodramas directed by Hawks or Preminger, yielded a more authentically modern art—as a result of its forthright confrontation with the existential crises of death and the human condition—than the more formalistic and overtly artful films of Welles, De Sica, or Wyler, which Bazin endorsed. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=889))
- Having quit his studies young, Godard was an autodidact, and in his first days he exhibited his independent learning with the pride of a self-made man. The exalted company of artistic notables was no accident: Godard considered the artists of Hollywood to be their peers, and conceived of the cinema as a high art, despite its origins in the fiercely commercial domain. ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=899))
- Then, in the January 1954 issue, François Truffaut’s ferocious polemic, “Une certaine tendance du cinéma français” (A Certain Tendency of the French Cinema), sparked an intellectual controversy that definitively put the magazine and its contributors on the map of French cultural life. ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1005))
- In it, Truffaut attacked the internationally respected films of the recent French cinema, the weighty literary adaptations (such as La Symphonie pastorale and Le Diable au corps) which garnered prizes at film festivals—the French “Tradition of Quality,” as it was called—and declared them worthless, indeed pernicious. ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1009))
- his key polemical point: “directors are, and wish to be, responsible for the scenarios and dialogues they illustrate.” Thus Truffaut, asserting directors to be the ultimate authors—“auteurs”—of their films, blamed them for the “vile beings,” the “infinitely grotesque” characters that they brought to the screen from the scripts he derided. Truffaut went on to list the eight French directors he considered “INCAPABLE of conceiving” such characters and such films: Jean Renoir, Robert Bresson, Jean Cocteau, Jacques Becker, Abel Gance, Max Ophüls, Jacques Tati, and Roger Leenhardt. As if to make clear that his contrast of these worthy eight to the rest of the French film industry is not merely one of degree, Truffaut drew the battle lines in the strident terms of the Cold War: “I do not believe in the peaceful coexistence of the ‘Tradition of Quality’ and an ‘auteur’s cinema.’” The ([Location 1014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1014))
- The “auteurists’” enthusiasm for the American cinema—as exemplified by Godard’s praise of films by Hitchcock, Hawks, and Preminger, and Rivette’s of Hawks—was not a blanket endorsement of the Hollywood studios’ entire industrial output. Instead, through careful viewing and passionate critical discussions, they recognized the artistry of a handful of Hollywood directors whose work they understood to be art of the first order despite its origins in a restrictive commercial system. ([Location 1025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1025))
- They asserted that these filmmakers, working in the studio system, were the artistic equals of the best filmmakers working anywhere else, and they took the filmmakers whose work they loved to be auteurs—the authors of their films, whose moral authority over their work and personal imprint on it made them the peers of novelists, painters, and composers.

- Overnight, Truffaut had become the angry prophet of the French cinema, and he and his circle of friends rapidly became as famous for the filmmakers they rejected—more or less the entire squad of French mainstream directors—as for those they championed. Yet unlike the nihilism of the the Lettrists and their successors, Truffaut and his friends were not merely conducting a scorched-earth policy; they were clearing the ground for the recognition of their own artistic heroes, avatars of what they considered a truer and worthier classicism, as well as their own artistic models in view of the day when they themselves would become filmmakers. ([Location 1035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1035))
- Soon after the notorious article was published, its publicity value became clear. Truffaut was invited by the editors of the weekly Arts-Lettres-Spectacles to join their film page: he would be published once a week, enjoy broad nationwide circulation, and be paid five times Cahiers’s per-page rate. ([Location 1049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1049))
- They wanted to talk about the cinema without being labeled as belonging to one or another side of a political conflict. As Fereydoun Hoveyda, who had started writing for Cahiers in 1954, recalled, almost everyone there was on the right (except Jacques Rivette and the older writer Pierre Kast), and Godard had the reputation as “rightist, almost fascist.” ([Location 1061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1061))
- Starting out from his earlier premise—that editing brought about an acute psychological reality through its spatial discontinuities—Godard now explained classical film editing in terms of modern philosophy from Heidegger to Sartre, asserting its power “to make the heart prevail over intelligence in destroying the notion of space in favor of that of time.” In a lapidary phrase, he asserted that “if direction is a look, editing is a heartbeat.” ([Location 1088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1088))
- “A film ingeniously directed does indeed give the impression of having been laid end to end, but a film ingeniously edited gives the impression of having suppressed all direction.” ([Location 1093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1093))
- Rossellini, born in 1906, was the most important Italian director of the day, though few in Italy still thought so. Although he had made several patriotic films under official auspices during the war, the unauthorized film that he made in 1945 in the last days of the war, Open City (starring Anna Magnani in a drama about resistance fighters and collaborators in Rome under the German occupation), inaugurated the neorealist school of filmmaking. ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1113))
- Rossellini abandoned the working-class politics of neorealism and located the new center of modern Italian life in the bourgeoisie. Replacing overtly political concerns with more abstract questions, Rossellini created a cinema of philosophical contemplation and symbolic abstraction in the framework of conventional melodrama. In effect, Rossellini made American-style films with European methods and ideas; and his new work, which was roundly derided by most of the European critics who had hailed the films of his first style, was appreciated, first and most vigorously, by the young critics at Cahiers. ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1120))
- One of the crucial aspects of the politique des auteurs as practiced by the young critics at Cahiers was its power to give them a personal “in” with film-makers they exalted and whose work they praised. ([Location 1126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1126))
- With its intimate fiction set in a landscape that Rossellini filmed with a documentary attentiveness and fidelity, Voyage to Italy inspired the Young Turks of Cahiers to consider the possibility of making highly structured dramas with spartan means. Specifically, Godard later recalled, he drew from the film a practical lesson: that to make a feature film, he needed only a pair of actors and a car. A low budget didn’t entail the constrained subject matter of a low-budget film like Rivette’s Quadrille, nor did the dramatic intensity of a script like Odile require access to outsized budgets and productions.

- In the texts of his short films as in his film reviews, Godard exhibited a prodigious recombinative intelligence, as in his extravagant and far-reaching wordplay, especially his puns, which made connections between similar-sounding signifiers in order to suggest comic relations between unrelated signifieds.

- A REGULAR FEATURE OF CAHIERS DU CINÉMA FROM November 1955 onward was the “Council of Ten,” in which critics from Cahiers and other publications rated new releases on a scale from “don’t bother” (a dot) to “masterpiece” (four stars) and the scores were collated into a ranked list. Godard was first polled for the issue of August—September 1957 and soon became a steady participant. In July 1959, the list was headed by Hiroshima, mon amour, Alain Resnais’s first feature film (from a script by Marguerite Duras), followed by Truffaut’s The 400 Blows and Howard Hawks’s Rio Bravo. ([Location 1385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1385))
- Only Godard had given all three films four stars, a gesture of recognition that their simultaneous release represented a landmark in cinema history: Hawks’s film exemplified classicism, Truffaut’s marked the French New Wave’s arrival on the world scene, and Resnais’s was a radical attempt at a cinematic modernism inspired by avant-garde literature. Godard, who was about to make his first feature film, conceived it in relation—and in opposition—to all three: against a dutiful approximation of Hawksian classicism; against Truffaut’s naturalistic form of memoir-autobiography; and against Resnais’s formalist modernism. ([Location 1392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1392))
- ALTHOUGH GODARD KNEW the story well, having worked on it with Truffaut, he was now at a loss as to how to tell it. ([Location 1441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1441))
- Until now, he had been a critic, a writer who wrote in response to preexisting material; and he was having trouble getting a story going on his own. ([Location 1448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1448))
- IN PARIS , GODARD worked on the adaptation of Breathless. His original plan had been to use Truffaut’s story outline and merely add dialogue to it. Instead, he remodeled the entire story, reconfiguring the action, adding and subtracting characters, and drastically shifting the emphases. ([Location 1487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1487))
- Also, Godard shifted the bulk of the action to his own stomping grounds—the Champs-Elysées (where Cahiers du cinéma was located), Montparnasse (the neighborhood of the hotel seen in Charlotte et son Jules), and St.-Germain-des-Prés—and even included in his treatment a geographical wink to Jean-Paul Sartre, showing the fugitive as he “crosses the boulevard Saint-Germain, passes in front of [the bookstore] la Hune and enters the courtyard of a building next to the Flore”17—the café made famous by Sartre during the war. Writing to Truffaut, Godard explained that “the action revolves around a car thief… in love with a girl who sells the New York Herald and takes courses in French civilization.”18 He similarly described the basic idea of the film he was about to make: “In general, the subject will be the story of a boy who thinks about death and that of a girl who doesn’t.” ([Location 1504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1504))
- The film’s autobiographical aspect is not found primarily in the plot, which does not depict (except in scattered details) incidents from Godard’s own life. Instead, Breathless is autobiographical at a higher level of abstraction: the concerns of the “boy” reflect Godard’s own. In making the film, Godard would find further, more radical, ways to redefine cinematic autobiography, but replacing autobiographical action with an autobiographical “subject” or idea was the first step. ([Location 1512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1512))
- His years as a critic and the philosophical inclinations that informed them bore fruit: despite his relative inexperience as a filmmaker, and his scant familiarity with the practical aspects of the cinema, he applied his ideas to the aesthetic and the technical elements of his film, and the results were revolutionary. ([Location 1532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1532))
- Breathless would be an “action film” in the sense of “action painting”: the act and the moment of making the film were as much a part of the work’s meaning as its specific content and style. As such, it would be the first existentialist film. ([Location 1537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1537))
- Godard wanted Breathless to be shot, as much as possible, like a documentary, with a handheld camera and a minimum of added lighting. This decision had both an aesthetic component, making the film look newsreel-like, and a practical one, saving the time usually spent setting up lights and a tripod. For several sequences that featured tracking shots, Godard avoided the use of cumbersome tracking rails (on which a wheeled dolly rolls, bearing the camera). Instead, Coutard filmed from a wheelchair pushed by Godard; and for the first sequence with Belmondo and Seberg on the Champs-Elysées, Godard, planning to film unnoticed by passersby, put Coutard inside a deliveryman’s pushcart into which two small viewing holes were cut in the front. An assistant pushed the cart and followed the unrecognized actors while Godard followed the action at a distance. ([Location 1546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1546))
- pretense but an accurate reflection of his conduct on the set. He habitually gave Coutard obscure, elliptical orders, as when he confusingly requested a close-up by asking that nothing be seen from the shoulders to the hips; when Coutard filmed something else, Godard said, “That’s all right,” and told him to move on to the next shot. As Coutard recalled, Godard often gave such negative instructions: “He said: ‘I want this and that not to be seen,’ and so you could pretty well figure it out… For instance, when he wanted a close-up, he said, ‘I don’t want to see the breast pocket on his shirt.’”24 On another occasion, Godard asked Coutard where the “best place” for the camera was, and then, after getting Coutard’s response, ordered that the camera be placed elsewhere. As Godard wrote to Braunberger: “My biggest job consists of keeping the technical crew away from the shoot. I am in a very bizarre state of mind, absolutely not crazed, and lazier than ever. I’m not thinking of anything.”25 ([Location 1569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1569))
- Wednesday, we shot a scene in direct sunlight with Geva 36. Everyone found it awful. I find it fairly extraordinary. It is the first time that one obliges the film stock to give the maximum of itself by making it do that for which it is not made. It is as if it were suffering by being exploited to the outer limit of its possibilities. Even the film stock, you see, will be out of breath. ([Location 1585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1585))
- Godard’s notion of correspondence between the movie and life behind the camera is a stern aesthetic that unifies the film and the work that went into it, the film and its maker: it is as if the camera were turned as surely on the director and his crew as on his actors, as if the camera were running as much between takes as during them. This idea, which renders film technique personal and renders the personal a product of technique, would prove to be the most lasting effect of Breathless on Godard’s work to come and a defining element of his contribution to cinema. ([Location 1589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1589))
- Godard included his friends in the film. He asked Jean-Pierre Melville—an independent filmmaker (born in 1917) who owned his own studio and made French crime movies with an American flair, including the legendary Bob le flambeur27—to play a voluble novelist whom Patricia would interview at Orly Airport for the New York Herald Tribune, and he named this character Parvulesco, after his Geneva friend, the right-wing philosopher. Godard wanted the scene to play like a real interview, and he asked Melville to improvise his answers—“to talk about women or anything I wanted, the way we did when we drove around at night.” ([Location 1594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1594))
- But the most unusual aspect of Godard’s technique concerned the script, or rather, the lack of one. As Godard wrote to Braunberger, “At the moment we really are shooting from day to day. I write the scenes while having breakfast at the Dupont Montparnasse.” ([Location 1601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1601))
- The film, however, was shot without direct sound (the entire sound track, including the dialogue, was to be post-synchronized, i.e., dubbed), and so, when the actors’ memory failed, Godard called their lines out to them while the camera was rolling. ([Location 1609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1609))
- Belmondo was sure that the film could not be edited into anything coherent and figured that it would never be released. ([Location 1615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1615))
- Godard’s spontaneous method deliberately frustrated the actors’ attempts to compose their characters in any naturalistic or psychologically motivated way. ([Location 1617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1617))
- Godard had calculated the rapidity of his methods, and counted on being able to fill a significant amount of screen time quickly, leaving the rest of his time free so that he could figure out the next day’s program. He often discharged his crew after what was officially only a half-day’s work, and on days when he did not feel inspired, he cancelled the shoot altogether. ([Location 1627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1627))
- While shooting the film, Godard made sure that he would be recognized. He gave himself a crucial, albeit minor, role, something far richer than a Hitchcockian cameo: he plays a passerby who recognizes the nearby Michel Poiccard from his picture in the paper and shows detectives which way the accused criminal went. ([Location 1644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1644))
- The calculated methods of publicity had the effect of canonizing Godard as an auteur before he even had something to show. ([Location 1651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1651))
- This process would serve as a template for Godard’s career: interviews have provided him with a parallel sound track on the public record and a vehicle for the intellectual profusion that spilled beyond the confines of his films. In the 1950s, Godard had used criticism to pour forth his ideas with an arch and allusive brilliance; now that he was a professional filmmaker, interviews would play that role, and would do so even better—for Godard had long been recognized, by those who knew him, as a brilliant talker. ([Location 1670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1670))
- The L’Express interview also provided the occasion for Godard’s first, and definitive, theoretical exposition of his idea of montage as the key element of the cinema: “I read three books a day. I didn’t do anything else. As a freshman,38 I started to go to the movies. But one day, I took off. I was twenty years old.” Manceaux asked Godard whether he had ever considered becoming awriter. Yes, of course. But I wrote, “The weather is nice. The train enters the station,” and I sat there for hours wondering why I couldn’t have just as well written the opposite: “The train enters the station. The weather is nice” or “it is raining.” In the cinema, it’s simpler. At the same time, the weather is nice and the train enters the station. There is something ineluctable about it. You have to go along with it. ([Location 1719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1719))
- Godard here laid out, minimally and powerfully, the notion he already asserted in his important writings of the 1950s, his view of montage as central to the cinema, indeed constitutive of it. His idea is to define montage as the simultaneous recording of disparate elements in a single image, the simultaneity in one image of two things that would happen sequentially on the page—the train entering the station, the rain falling. In his view, the cinema does automatically what literature wants to do and cannot: it connects two ideas in one time. ([Location 1728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1728))
- Godard asked Jean-Pierre Melville for advice on how to cut it down: I told him to cut everything that didn’t keep the action moving, and to remove all unnecessary scenes, mine included. He didn’t listen to me, and instead of cutting whole scenes as was the practice then, he had the brilliant idea of cutting more or less at random within scenes. The result was excellent.39 Godard (and the editor, Cécile Decugis, who essentially executed Godard’s instructions) did not, for the most part, cut at random;40 on the contrary, he responded to his enthusiasms, and removed all moments—within scenes, even within shots—that seemed to him to lack vigor. He kept in the film only what he thought was strongest, regardless of dramatic import or conventional continuity, thus producing many jump cuts, where characters and anything else that moves within the shot seem to jump from one position to another in a relatively fixed frame. ([Location 1737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1737))
- The jump cut, despite—and because of—its ill-repute, became one of the principal figures of the visual style of Breathless. ([Location 1747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1747))
- The overall result is an accelerated and syncopated rhythm, made of leaps ahead and doublings-back, a sort of visual jazz (with Godard as the improvising soloist) that outswung the American detective and gangster films that had served as Godard’s models. ([Location 1761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1761))
- The jump cut is a device that Godard subsequently reused only rarely. He soon devised other, and more sophisticated, methods for conjuring his presence in his films. ([Location 1763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1763))
- BREATHLESS IS NOTABLE for still another kind of montage, the assembly of allusions and references to film history. Not only did Godard film Breathless in the style of an American film noir, he stocked it with citations from the American cinema. ([Location 1769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1769))
- of Rivette and Rohmer—hardly resembled it. As filmmakers, the group from Cahiers kept their relations with the films they loved tacit and implicit. Only Godard made a film that in story, in style, and in substance is directly derived from the American movies they admired. ([Location 1782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1782))
- For Godard, the cinema’s ability to combine two ideas in one image made it better than writing as a representation of his thought processes. The technical complexities of the cinema were nonetheless obstacles to a spontaneity of expression comparable to that of a writer, but Godard’s unusual methods both made the medium more responsive to his immediate inclinations and made that spontaneity apparent in the film itself. ([Location 1788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1788))
- The viewer’s crucial and primary emotional identification is not with any filmed character but with Godard. ([Location 1794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1794))
- And Godard was thinking not only about films, but also about books, paintings, and music, elements of culture directly transmitted through the film by citations in images or on the sound track. Indeed, Breathless bore the burden of Godard’s intense autodidacticism, with quotations from and references to literature (Faulkner, Dylan Thomas, Aragon, Rilke, Françoise Sagan, Maurice Sachs), paintings (Picasso, Renoir, Klee), and music (Mozart and Bach). ([Location 1797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1797))
- The result was a first-person documentary of a distinctive, indeed a unique, sort: this first-person cinema invoked not the director’s experience but his presence. ([Location 1802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1802))
- Breathless was both a work of existential engagement with the world—an engagement that was constant, essential, and involuntary, inasmuch as it was a collage of preexisting material—and therefore also a work of Sartrean bad faith, made by a thinker who did not think but was thought. ([Location 1809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1809))
- Breathless is the cornerstone film of the French New Wave because it is the one that explicitly claims the group’s intellectual heritage (American movies, modern literature, a polemical yet highly rhetorical critical style) while at the same time brandishing the group’s hectic, threadbare, disreputable social circumstances. ([Location 1820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1820))
- Godard instantly became the embodiment of cinema, the New Wave, intellectual fashion, and intellectualism as fashion. ([Location 1826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1826))
- With Breathless, Cahiers du cinéma immediately became, in effect, the most important film school in France: the technical training formerly considered indispensable was now, virtually overnight, displaced by the wisdom offered by Langlois at his unofficial conservatory. ([Location 1866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1866))
- THOUGH FEW YOUNG filmmakers would imitate Breathless, many would imitate Godard himself, such as Breathless revealed him to be: an artistically voracious autodidact devoted fanatically to the history of cinema. ([Location 1868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1868))
- As the director of a film born of a unique mode of production and philosophical orientation, he also required the appropriate conditions for a correct appreciation of his unusual work. He needed, in other words, to generate—and to induce critics to employ—a method of criticism that was apt for his own film. This was his self-appointed task as an interviewee. He needed to speak directly to his viewers in order to orient their viewing, and he made sure to become enough of a celebrity to get his voice quickly heard. ([Location 1872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1872))
- This sonic coincidence is no accident: the ambulance siren at that moment was added by Godard as a deliberate choice in the sound editing process (inasmuch as Breathless was shot silent and the sound track dubbed, all of the film’s sounds were intentionally applied) and its presence is a reference to the death of Godard’s mother in a motorcycle accident. Godard left the reference apparent to those who might perceive it but hidden from those who would not—yet given his sudden great celebrity, it was inevitable that the underlying facts would come out, and would render the passage explicable. ([Location 1902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FO7F6LM&location=1902))
- Journalists were part of Godard’s system, providing skeleton keys to the work as they created the phenomenon on which they were reporting. Viewers and readers, upon their initiation into the film’s esoterica, themselves popularized the advanced cinematic philosophy that Breathless represented, becoming the first citizens of the new republic the film heralded: the republic of media self-consciousness, of the fusion of communication with theories of communication, of criticism with art.
