Trying to reconcile:

* The steam-rolling manifest-destiny shit of innovation (see: [[What do we mean when we say innovation? ↯]])
  * (possibly #note/refactor  to combine these)
* And: [[Definite Optimism as Human Capital  Dan Wang]], particularly idea of innovation in stories, and "positive" sci-fi: ![[Definite Optimism as Human Capital  Dan Wang#^06f51b]]
  * I guess see also: [[⟁ sci-fi]] and particularly idea of [[utopian sci-fi]] (e.g. [[Ursula Le Guin]])
