up:: [[My dharma path]]

In [[Buddhism]], training in:

* higher virtue
* higher mind
* higher wisdom

It can also be extrapolated to the [[Eightfold Path]]:

Now, we could think of the threefold training in the form that [RomeoStevens offers](http://neuroticgradientdescent.blogspot.com/2021/03/threefold-training.html): concentration, insight, and integration.

Concentration includes the [[jhanas]]. [[insight]] is typically mindfulness practices, leading to [[Awakening]]. And integration is the interesting one: we might look at that as [[Therapy & Integration MOC]] ([[Internal Family Systems|IFS]]), Relational practices (like Circling) or Physical Practices (Tai Chi? Exercise? Yoga?).
