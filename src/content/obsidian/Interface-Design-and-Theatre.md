The canonical text that "connects" theatre and computers is Brenda Laurel's 1990s masterwork, *Computers as Theatre* ([[laurel1991 Computers as theatre]]).

The analogy extends deep. For example, in web design, I think about how translating elements on/off screen is like set pieces hiding in the wings, just off stage. But fundamentally, [[Computing and theatre are both based on metaphor (E.202203021304)]]
