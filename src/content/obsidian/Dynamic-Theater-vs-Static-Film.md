Because [[Theater is created with a spontaneous web of conditions, ala dependent arising in Buddhism]] that are dependent on its live-ness, it can be considered "dynamic", i.e. it's created in the moment.

Film, on the other hand, is more static: it is created and edited — itself influenced by the web of conditions that lead to its arising — and then it is "released". Films as static objects generally don't change after they are released. Thus the relationship, viewed through this lens, is more static and two-dimensional.

But this doesn't quite tell the full story of the audience relationship created by film. While theater/audience's relationship is symbiotic, in Film there is a "third" point of origin: the viewing of the film itself. This is what changes and becomes dynamic, is influenced and symbiotic. Thus film viewings are changed deeply by context, and informed by culture. They can be viewed in an academic lens, in  a "Blockbuster" lens, or through a Midnight Movie cult-classic lens (ie Rocky Horror). I flesh this out in: [[Film and its subsequent viewings are informed and created by Pop Culture]]
