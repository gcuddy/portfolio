## notes

(side note: it feels funny even highlighting this/copy-pasting notes — quite literally antithetical!)



Old school xanadu/hypertext concepts privelege plain text:
![[2022-09-06-13-36-01-Future of Text Journal 1.2 March 2022.pdf.jpg]]
- Implicit in that privilege is "English prose" as a base. Alphabet, keyboard, rectangular screen, plain text:
> I guess, fundamentally, I’m uncomfortable with the whole framing of ‘text’. I think that it comes with a lot of unhelpful baggage and connotations. When I start with ‘text’ as my basic concept, at some level, I’m starting with English prose, and alphabetic letters, and keyboards, and a rectangular screen or a piece of paper on a desk, and ‘plain text’ filese.

Manipulating text is easy, but images/video is hard. Why is that? Maybe 50 years ago it made sense, but now still text is central.

Computers constantly push you to explain things with text — because adding figures is such a monstrosity.
- A corollary: this seems to be at odds, or in some way play with, the popularity of [[TikTok]], [[Instagram]], and [[YouTube]]. And [[Atlas/Notes/Sources/Articles/Zia Anger on Why Moving Images Are More Important Than Words]]
	- Instagram, for instance, makes screenshots ubiquitous because you can't even copy/paste the captions! It's totally a visual medium. In some ways it feels very very different than original roles of Internet. [[The original proposal of the WWW, HTMLized]]

Fundamentally, manipulating text is a regression from paper, since paper allows you to intermingle drawing/sketching/doodling/writing.

> (On a piece of paper, drawing is no different from writing; it doesn’t represent a change of mode; you don’t have to build up the emotional energy to move off your keyboard and open a different file and a different application.)

"==Text is the default, and it's a bad default=="

"Micro-interactions will dominate over conceptual models and data structures:"

good micro-interacttions: iphone, video games, social media/scrolling

Text on the computer has a "manipulability" to it, interacting with it feels easy and fluid. Part of this is hardware capital (every computer has a keyboard)

But if smartphone is real 'personal com'uter', then future where micrphone/camera/multitouch surface becomes favored mode of interaction
(see of course requisite: [cc:: [[A Brief Rant on The Future of Interaction Design by Bret Victor]]])

Again, Rizwan points to looking at how computers have *actually* been adopted. The interactions that have emerged are focused more around smartphones.

Text is excllusoinary: it excludes complexity aorund speech/writing. Excludes graphics obviously. And what about characters (i.e. [[Sinica Podcast - Yale’s Jing Tsu on the characters who modernized Chinese characters]])

> Text is a strangely (historically and culturally) specific bundle of technology to orient a vision of the future around. Text is important, but it’s gotten a lot of attention already. There’s something that’s always a little exclusionary about text. It excludes the complexity that can go into full-fledged speech and writingaa. It excludes inline graphics and diagrams and notations that are often vital tools for understanding and problem-solving. I hope that the future of media will be broader than that.
