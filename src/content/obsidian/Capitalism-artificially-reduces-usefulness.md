up:: [[capitalism]]

Because [[the primary value of capitalism is profit]], capitalism will artificially insert profit margins around useful things (literally utiltities). An example of this is the internet. Why do we have several different internet speeds? It doesn't affect the ISPs. Internet is a utility, and we should all have the fastest internet, because that's what valuing our collective freedom entails.

[[𖠫 This Life - Martin Hägglund]]: 
> - An instructive example is Internet service. Under democratic socialism, everyone would have Internet access at the maximal speed enabled by our currently available technology, with a collective commitment to create technology that makes Internet access even faster and possible to maintain with even less socially necessary labor. While our democratic state provides the Internet service, the actual use and applications of the Internet are not restricted by the dictates of a central planning committee. Rather, we have both the material resources and the socially available free time to develop applications that resolve problems which emerge in “the particular circumstances of time and place”—to recall Hayek’s language—allowing for “the utilization of knowledge which is not given to anyone in its totality” and drawing on “unique information of which beneficial use might be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to [the individual] or are made with his active cooperation.” ([Location 5156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5156))
> - In a ==capitalist free market, by contrast, Internet service will always be provided by regional monopolies that operate for profit.== Contrary to what Hayek assumes, monopolies tend to form naturally in a free market, since private ownership of the required technological infrastructure makes it harder and harder to compete with the company that has built the dominant network. Given the profit motive, a company has no inherent interest in offering us general Internet access at the maximal speed possible. Slower and partial access will be preferred if that is more profitable. ([Location 5168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5168))
