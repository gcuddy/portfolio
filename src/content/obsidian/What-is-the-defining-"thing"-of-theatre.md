What is theatre's defining "thing"?

Here are some possibilities:

* Energy: [[Theatre is sculpting energy in three-dimensional space]]
* Ephemerality: theater appears, then disappears (see: [[Is Ephemerality an essential quality to theatre?]])
* Presence, breath, collective liveness, etc...
* Scarcity: theater exists in one place, at one time (see: [[Scarcity is inherent to theater — isn't it?]], [[§Artificial Scarcity 20210310]])
* Ritual: ([[Theatre as ritual]])
  * ![[The Qualities of Great Theatre#Great theatre is an event-ritual]]
* Theater as having a "civic role", in the Ancient Greek sense: [[Theater as a part of a functioning city]] ![[Ivo Van Hove on re Directing Zoom notes#Civic role of theater]]
* [[Theater as a space for collective dreaming and unconscioous]]
  * Ivo talks about this in [[Ivo Van Hove on re Directing Zoom notes#Civic role of theater]]
    * Also in Theatre Laid Bare
    * [[The Qualities of Great Theatre]]

Other possibilities:

* Politics?
* Justice?
* Democracy?
