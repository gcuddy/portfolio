# Non-actors help make film feel like film.

Stage and film are two similar, yet completely different mediums. In film, performances that would work well on stage often feel hammy and overdone. This is because the two mediums are fundamentally different ([[theatre is a medium of metaphor]], [[film is a medium of creation]]).

Films that make use of real-life people tends to be compelling because they can feel totally naked and authentic; they can have a magnetism that an actor "mimicking" can never quite reproduce. (See: [[Art involves creation, not just reproduction]])

Many of my favorite directors use non-actors, or mix actors with non-actors, to create experiences that feel totally **alive**. (See: [[Art needs to feel alive.]]) See:

* Robert Bresson
* Safdie Brothers
* Bicycle Thieves
