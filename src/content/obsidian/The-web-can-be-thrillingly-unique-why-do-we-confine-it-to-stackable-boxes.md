The early web — [[Geocities]] and its offspring, such as [[MySpace]] — were places to be yourself, to own your turf on the web. Design played a crucial factor.

Web 2.0, with its focus on user-generated content, strangely left out design. Design has been swallowed up by large tech companies that borrow from a familiar aesthetic. Content, from users, is confined to the boxes and squares that the platform gives us — the stackable boxes of Twitter and Instagram come to mind. (See also: [[Everything in web2 looks the same]])

There's a trade-off here, of course — [[There's always a trade-off between user theming and opinionated design 20210917003700]] — but as a result the web tends to look the same, and lacks... chaos? Personality?

Personal websites are an interesting stake in the ground towards reclaiming some of that early web magic. It should be mentioned that this is partially a goal of [[web3]] — though its embrace does feel shallow and profit-centric, co-opting 80s nostalgia with a heavy, blockchain approach. The Web is ultimately the primitive of the future — so much will be built on top of it (for better or for worse). This is why Electron apps that offer easy CSS customization (like Obsidian) are a fascinating double-edged sword, but ultimately they do introduce people to CSS, and introduce the idea of designing a little digital home for yourself.
