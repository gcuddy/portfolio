I miss when you could actually press buttons. The sound of turning on a monitor.

Things grounded in the physical world; distinctive relationships with media. Spilling cheese puff dust on the Blockbuster copy of Star Wars. Putting the VHS into the VCR player.

The relationship was different... xx

The cord of the phone

Examples:

* Halt and Catch Fire / Syllabus

#inbox

I do acknowledge role nostalgia has to play. And for instance we can always be nostalgic about media prior. For instance the [[Sony walkman]] and iPod isolated music to the personal; music previously played mostly on speakers.
