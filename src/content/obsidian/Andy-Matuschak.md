#person

* Andy is an [[independent researcher]], writer, and thinker in the realm of [[tools for thought]]. He's become especially popular/notable in the [[PKM]] world for his [[note-taking system]] that centers around his #coinage of Evergreen Notes]], which itself is largely drawn from [[Roam/How to Take Smart Notes]] and the [[Zettelkasten]] system.
* His Taxonomy of Note Types
  * For me, the practice of writing and revising notes is, at its core, about trying to move up the following rough ladder:
    * Ephemeral scratchings in [Daily working log](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z28QkpK3vRKQTacjFDfGYBhCXHqHuVWJzny9)
    * Prompts and incomplete notes in writing inbox ([A writing inbox for transient and incomplete notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5aJUJcSbxuQxzHr2YvaY4cX5TuvLQT7r27Dz)), which are meant to possibly become [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C). These prompts may accumulate writing over time via spaced repetition (see [Spaced repetition may be a helpful tool to incrementally develop inklings](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7iCjRziX6V6unNWL81yc2dJicpRw2Cpp9MfQ))
    * [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C), in increasingly complex stages of development:
      * stubs implicitly defined through backlinks ([Backlinks can be used to implicitly define nodes in knowledge management systems](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2newCwFfd6iZFyf9bgspkbyt1G8wbQxJVgTK)); e.g. [Note-writing system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8XrKGDz49o6XxEx7tzGewzrXQnw6jSgv3Yyf), [Audiobooks](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zhjve4ix3DcGqVGZn3a7FCP7bZTvzVR99fd)
      * simple definitions for terms of art, little of my own added; e.g. [Span of absolute judgment](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/ziwhFzgTbrS2uxWEkCvoJzQrDzRz5EAWWZFy), [Spacing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5oCe7JTrkYfmb6SHE4n5HxisE7PdwS6nmXEw)
        * [Bridge notes narrowly relate two adjacent terms](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6eWsRsp4aWrQ8YbyYqsUNLg2g5ZXGcTy9Dpo)
      * precise, narrow declarative notes ([Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3KmNj3oKKSTJfqdfSEBzTQiCVGoC4GfK3rYW)); e.g. [Human channel capacity increases with stimulus dimensionality](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7LQGcrQpYKed1qdC1nS7Dg8Ad6gdi1apWyuZ)
        * sometimes these are framed as questions, when evidence is too inconclusive to frame sharply; e.g. [To what extent is exceptional ability heritable?](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6Ndn5nmxLWsrQQ3ZLHsxHsokGTycgo17XGYi), [To what extent can application prompts supplant recall prompts in the mnemonic medium?](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3ERHM3aC9jCyTR5KpgxTAyXf7kNSkG57SqrR)
      * higher-level APIs ([Evergreen note titles are like APIs](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3XP5GRmd9z1D2qCE7pxUvbeSVeQuMiqz9x1C))
        * notes abstracting over many other notes, e.g. [Educational games are a doomed approach to creating enabling environments](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7wPt3dxX5hp6LK3PLUBTJXxk7kAhMuh8UDck), [Reading texts on computers is unpleasant](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7yjjydTNu3bujTeFc7Hey1iFbz513SnN6oss)
        * personal terms of art, e.g. [Enacted experience](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3KASfpz5AmNmqM2m517Jbs1EvXrLN7NkeYWH)
    * “Outline notes”, e.g. [§Enabling environments, games, and the Primer](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z244xx3kMf1v8UnkZKUwQBAwBsHLpUgN4YhsG)
  * Note types outside this ladder:
    * Proper noun notes
      * “Literature notes”, titled after a single work and meant primarily as linkages to other more durable notes, and as targets for backlinks. I write these roughly as “outline notes,” except for someone else’s ideas. For example: [Miller - The magical number seven, plus or minus two](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zjfsd9pyxWQAF3HU5k7RAXhRjJBqtMEGKK27)
      * Likewise, but less commonly, I also have “person notes” (e.g. [Anand Agarawala](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zt4GTjHg25rMXYdsN1Xv92xBsZwseJcVCxa)) and “business notes” (e.g. [Confluent](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7pG74eZRBjyxw8tyZooECQ2v5fZzZCGCzqQs))
      * These note types are weakly evergreen. I may add to them over time, but because they aren’t concept-oriented ([Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6bci25mVUBNFdVWSrQNKr6u7AZ1jFzfTVbMF)), they’re not as useful to build on as an evergreen note. Non-trivial writing about proper nouns typically gets factored into separate evergreen notes which can be used in multiple places.
    * “Log” notes, which accumulate ephemeral observations about a specific practice, system, or project over time. They’re akin to a [Daily working log](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z28QkpK3vRKQTacjFDfGYBhCXHqHuVWJzny9), but sliced by some topic of interest rather than by date. e.g. [personal mnemonic medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Log)
      * With better transclusion or support for [Contextual backlinks](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3RzQhmjeRxXVAAy81aUSKARwJL8dikdJG4VG), such notes could be written directly in one’s [Daily working log](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z28QkpK3vRKQTacjFDfGYBhCXHqHuVWJzny9), and “log” notes could be defined as a query over such notes.
  * Tactically speaking, I usually denote a note’s “type” with a tag.
  * Don’t over-obsess or over-formalize this stuff. Remember: [“Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7kEFe6NfUSgtaDuUjST1oczKKzQQeQWk4Dbc).
