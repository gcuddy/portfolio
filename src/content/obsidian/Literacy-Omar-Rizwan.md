contra:: [[Orality and Literacy]]

I keep meaning to write something in one of these emails about orality and literacy, and I keep pushing it back. I can never quite figure out what to say about it, but I keep finding fragments that would fit into whatever it is. so I've decided I'll just put some stuff here, without trying to argue anything in particular:

[[Tweet thread on Arabic Numerals - mbarany]]

([maybe also related](https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1261851189659885571), on definitions of 'literacy' – the original thread is unfortunately gone, and I'm going to butcher it, but it was something like, critique of the question of 'how many medieval English people (?) could read', because maybe you'd, for instance, have a local priest who could read, and that is a form of 'communal literacy', and texts would be oriented toward that! it's a worthwhile category to have! would that count or not? the whole phrasing of the question assumes our modern notions of 'literacy' and the individual)

(there's another maybe-related deleted thread, where I only have a screenshot of one of its tweets: "Believing that images can be understood more easily than words is by definition a logocentric stance. That logocentrism has an ugly history and ugly implications today.")

I guess I'm drawn to these because I feel like there is some level of uncritical adoption in 'our community' of models that practicing historians and anthropologists would be [uncomfortable with](https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1272259648708464640), that are maybe a bit dated or heterodox or naive (or triumphalist, or omit the role of power, or omit some kind of contingency or path-dependence or context-specificity)

in college, I took this 1:1 tutorial in anthropology of media and technology (I still continue to mine and learn from it, tbh). one thing I talked to my tutor about was this tendency I saw among anthropologists toward particularity, a discomfort with generalization (a discomfort with saying that 'this technology has this effect', rather than 'this technology happened to have this effect within a very specific historical and social context and we can't say anything more than that'). discomfort with linear pseudo-quantitative scales like 'progress' or 'complexity' or 'expressive power'. ==everything is different and particular and incommensurable, and your job is only to describe it== ^61caa4

also that they don't have an engineering or design orientation, so maybe it doesn't seem useful (to them) to generalize. I tend to find qualitative work more creatively useful than quantitative work – because I want to find weird and different ways of doing things, I want to ==unlearn the way I see computing and media==, my mind likes to have concrete examples and stories to anchor to, and I don't care about 'the best way' to do something along some fixed axis – but this does leave me a little cold. I am, after all, still trying to invent stuff, not only participate in a conversation within a field
