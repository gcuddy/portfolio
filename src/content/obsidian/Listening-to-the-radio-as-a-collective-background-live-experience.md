I've really enjoyed listening to the radio as of late, specifically WQXR. I like it more than listening to Spotify sometimes, especially when I'm feeling lonely, because I like that it's a sort of collective live experience that's very low stakes. I like imagining other people listening to it at the same time, I like that the hosts talk to me. It really makes me feel less alone. A "background" collective experience. What are the other degrees of this? The other examples? e.g. versus theater

Another "background" live experience is often live streaming, such as on Twitch, Instagram Live, or YouTube. I've struggled to understand the popularity of "streamers" before, but when I contextualize "watching others play video games" as a sort of ambient live experience, it makes more sense.

Yet, we're trying to solve our loneliness with the very technologies that created it in the first place. Radio (and college radio, pirate radio, internet radio, and the ilk) has always felt like a sufficiently ambient technology to make sense.

[[The Audio Revolution]] — Danco says that audio is the hottest of all mediums, but I've never understood this. How is it hotter than Twitch? (Perhaps it's talking specifically about AM Radio i.e. Fox News)

I guess this is why streaming is popular too... sure it's similar, but to a different extent?

Makes me feel "part of something"

Also: Danco on this, radio is more popular than we think lol...

I like that the radio host addresses us all New York City-ites together, and I like to imagine other folks in the city listening to this at the same time as well. It's quite pleasant to me.

This is now a general "on radio" note...
Look at WQXR mentions
NTS
etc

Love having these on in the background because it feels alive
cc Live streaming, Twitch, work streams, etc.
