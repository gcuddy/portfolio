description: The sixtieth anniversary edition of Frantz Fanon’s landmark text, now with a new introduction by Cornel West First published in 1961, and reissued in this sixtieth anniversary edition with a powerful new introduction by Cornel West, Frantz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth is a masterfuland timeless interrogation of race, colonialism, psychological trauma, and revolutionary struggle, and a continuing influence on movements from Black Lives Matter to decolonization. A landmark text for revolutionaries and activists, The Wretched of the Earth is an eternal touchstone for civil rights, anti-colonialism, psychiatric studies, and Black consciousness movements around the world. Alongside Cornel West’s introduction, the book features critical essays by Jean-Paul Sartre and Homi K. Bhabha. This sixtieth anniversary edition of Fanon’s most famous text stands proudly alongside such pillars of anti-colonialism and anti-racism as Edward Said’s Orientalism and The Autobiography of Malcolm X.

## foreword: framing fanon by Homi K. Bhabha

- Context: he's writing during colonial racism experienced in metropolitan France in 1950s and then anticolonial Algerian war of liberation
- Question proposed by foreword: is Fanon dated? (In his answer being violence, and in saying things like national consciousness depends on cultural homogeniety)
	- His hopes in the Algerian revolution would be dashed by military rule and rise of Islamic fundamentalist groups
- Biographer of Fanon to check out: David Macey 
- Fanon is resolute that Third World should embrace socialism, while also insisting that Third World must not be content in defining itself in relation to the values that preceded it. Thus new humanism cannot occur until bipolar tensions of cold war are put to rest.

> "New" national, international, or global emergences create an unsettling sense of transition, as if history is at a turning point; and it is in such incu- bational moments-Antonio Gramsci's word for the perceived "newness" of change-that we experience the palimpsestical im- prints of past, present, and future in peculiarly contemporary fig- ures of time and meaning. Fanon's description of the "crude, empty fragile shell" of emergent national histories quickens the long shadows cast by the ethnonationalist "switchbacks" of our own times, the charnel houses of ethnic cleansing: Bosnia, Rwanda, Kosovo, Gujarat, Sudan.

Helpful contextualization of the reception/perception of *Wretched of the Earth*:
> Now many readers have held that The Wretched ofthe Earth is long on prophecy and polemics and short on policy and plan- ning- a deliberately universalized level ofanalysis that has led The Wretched ofthe Earth to become, as Stuart Hall has remarked, the "Bible of decolonisation."24

Fanon calls for redistribution of wealth as the central issue (something I disagree with on a practical level, because it doesn't go far enough — (see:: [[revolution requires revaluation, not (just) redistribution]]))

Bhabha then turns to discussing Fanon's exploration of the "psycho-affective realm". He writes:
> It is Fanon's great contribu- tion to our understanding of ethical judgment and political experience to insistently frame his reflections on violence, de- colonization, national consciousness, and humanism in terms ofthe ==psycho-affective realm-the body, dreams, psychic inver- sions and displacements, phantasmatic political identifications==. A psycho-affective relation or response has the semblance of uni- versality and timelessness because it involves the emotions, the imagination or psychic life, but it is only ever mobilized into so- cial meaning and historical effect through an embodied and em- bedded action, an engagement with (or resistance to) a given reality, or a performance of agency in the present tense.

Violence:

> The colonial vocabulary is shot through with arro- gance, antagonism, and anxiety: those hysterical masses; their blank faces; this vegetative existence.34 The colonized, who are often devoid of a public voice, resort to dreaming, imagining, acting out, embedding the reactive vocabulary of violence and retributive justice in their bodies, their psyches: "To blow the colonial world to smithereens is henceforth a clear image within the grasp and imagination of every colonized subject. T o dislo- cate the colonial world.... To destroy the colonist's sector.... Challenging the colonial world is not a rational confrontation of viewpoints. It is not a discourse on the universal, but the im- passioned claim by the colonized that their world is fundamen- tally different."35

Hannah Arendt led an assault on the book in the late 60s attempting to staunch the wildfire of glorifying violence that was spreading across universities — but acknowledging that it's Sartre's preface that perhaps glorifies violence beyond what Fanon wanted.
