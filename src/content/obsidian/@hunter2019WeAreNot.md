"Live broadcast theatre complicates the putative ontological separation between staged performances and screened ones—between the theatre the companies broadcast and the films the venues more usually host—in particularly visible ways. **It also suggests theatre as a multifarious and adaptive form, capable of distinguishing itself not only, and perhaps not even primarily, by its ==ephemerality==, or the embodied co-presence of actor and performer, but rather by the specificity of the techniques and conventions that produce it**." ([Hunter 2019:16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=2)) ^cb3157

"In an especially illustrative example, the opening of Sarah Bay-Cheng's essay "Theatre Is Media" paints a picture of even conventionally live theatre as inextricably imbricated with digital media—in particular, when she recounts her experience attending the Donmar Warehouse production of King Lear, starring Derek Jacobi, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) during its US tour." ([Hunter 2019:16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=2))

"From the email newsletter by which she learned about the production, to online reviews of its run in London, to her own tweets and blog postings on the production in reflection, Bay-Cheng narrates a path through her experience of the production "unbounded by the duration of the performance in BAM's Harvey Theater." She argues persuasively that the live performance arguably at the center of that experience did not constitute "a privileged site of temporary encounter," but rather "**yet another form of mediated interaction**" with its "text, contexts, and artifacts" (ibid.)." ([Hunter 2019:16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=2))

"NT Live, which premiered in 2009, adapted a model for simultaneous broadcast of work from the stage that was pioneered by the Metropolitan Opera in its Live in HD series, which debuted in 2006." ([Hunter 2019:16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=2))

"While the broadcasts' deployment of the rhetoric of liveness may appear to affirm the centrality of liveness to the theatre, the success their producers claim in removing theatre to the screen—producing "the theatre squared," as Bay-Cheng puts it (2007, 37)—**simultaneously implies otherwise, suggesting temporal liveness, evanescence, and co-presence between an audience and performers as less than necessary for an object that nonetheless aspires to the condition of theatre**. Given the producing companies' evident desire to connect such broadcasts firmly to the traditions and ontology of theatre, I argue that the products act didactically, potentially characterizing or elucidating theatre and its making for a global audience. In the ways they seek to make the experience of theatre explicit, such mediatizations in effect explicate stage performance, **acting not merely as a representation of theatre, but a definition of it, one that often conserves and reifies traditional norms and expectations attached to the form**." ([Hunter 2019:17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=3))

"There is no established nomenclature under which to group these relatively new and distinct practices and products, but what they have in common at a basic level is the project of mediatizing live theatrical works from the theatre in more or less available light without removal of the production to a soundstage—a feature that also distinguishes twentieth-century televisual products like Live from Lincoln Center and some BBC television broadcasts of theatrical productions directly from the stage." ([Hunter 2019:17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=3))

"**Significantly, they have in common a desire to safeguard the name of theatre for the mediatized product; that is, not to produce an adaptation for the screen but to grant access to a theatrical original, one that is recognized as such and that does not completely relinquish the ontology of theatre in order to be apprehended as a construction of cinema or television**. Despite a tendency, as noted by scholar and Live from Stratford producer John Wyver, to use nomenclature for the broadcasts like "'cinema broadcasts,' 'event cinema,' and 'live cinema relays,'" which link them with the tradition of film, production and marketing teams remain quite eager to distance the broadcasts from the tradition of cinema itself (2016, n.p.)." ([Hunter 2019:18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=4))

"Both Wyver and David Sabel, the head of digital media for the NT during the development of NT Live, have described explaining the live broadcast process and product to theatre casts and crews by differentiating it from film-making: "'We are not making a movie' was a mantra that was repeated frequently by the creative teams for both the theatre production and the broadcast," Wyver writes (2015, 5). Sabel ends a description of the NT Live broadcast process in a 2013 TEDx Talk by emphasizing, "\[l\]et me be clear: we're not making a movie. . . . What we're trying to do is make the production look as great on screen as it would on one of our stages" (n.p.)." ([Hunter 2019:18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=4))

"Not so television; as Auslander notes in his description of television's theatrical heritage, in the medium's early days, "\[t\]elevision's essence was seen in its ability to transmit events as they occur," its "claim to immediacy" suggesting it as a lens through which to view the world unadulterated—and not incidentally, a more fitting vehicle than film for the remediation of theatre (12-13). Wyver has suggested that although phenomena like NT Live are commonly referred to as "live cinema," they might be better considered as part of a tradition of "theatre television" that stretches from nearly the inception of the televisual medium, noting that the BBC's live televisual broadcasts of theatrical productions date from 1938 (2016, n.p.)." ([Hunter 2019:18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=4))

"Accordingly, the way that broadcast crews seem to understand their mission to capture and relay live action from the theatre is right in line with how television promotes its coverage of live events generally: by promising not the artifice of cinema, but a transmission of actual events—a record of what happens" ([Hunter 2019:18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=4))

"Products like NT Live and the RSC's live broadcasts are, in effect, recorded live before a studio audience, one that stands in for the larger primary audience outside the theatre; the cinema audience's experience is explicitly prioritized on the night of the broadcast (fig. 1). In practical terms, that means there is no effort to hide the cameras, cables, and other equipment (and technicians) that produce the broadcast inside the theatre; at the RSC, entire rows of seats are removed to accommodate the position and mobility of the cameras necessary to achieve all the scripted angles for the broadcast, and audiences seated in the theatre are certain to notice the motion of cameras as they maneuver during and between shots." ([Hunter 2019:18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=4))

"This perspective is echoed in Desmond Davis's The Grammar of Television Production, which Lough recommended to some aspiring students during my observation. As Davis has it, in television production, "\[t\]he best technique highlights that which is important, eliminates that which is unimportant and obliterates itself by its own perfection" (10). "We don't aspire to poetry," Lough told me; rather, "we try to interpret \[the action onstage\] the best way we can. . . . I don't like shots where someone is going, 'I love what you're doing with the crane. . . . I just want them to think, 'That to-be-or-not-to-be soliloquy is fantastic.'"5" ([Hunter 2019:19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=5))

"The production team's determination of what to attempt to preserve or reflect in the translated rendering speaks volumes about what might be considered necessary, fundamental, and specific not only to any individual theatrical production, but to theatre itself." ([Hunter 2019:21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=7))

"The NT Live and Live from Stratford series, after all, prioritize liveness in their very names. Of the current crop, even those digital translations that do not involve broadcast, like Digital Theatre's recordings of staged productions available for on-demand streaming, could all be read as engaging with some kind of liveness strategy. These run the gamut from a general effacement of the apparatus doing the recording to, in the case of NT Live, a constellation of choices that seems designed to make a mediatized product carry as many of the vestiges and marks of liveness as possible: synchronous, local public consumption; a gesture toward theatre's seemingly constitutive "nowness" through the simultaneity of broadcast; and also, in an interesting complication of the NT's mission to increase public access to its work, a disappearance strategy. After the single live broadcast, the NT restricts access to NT Live recordings to viewing on location in its archives and to encore presentations in cinemas; it neither offers viewing by demand, as Digital Theatre does, nor sells DVDs of the recordings, as the RSC does (some of which are also available on the Digital Theatre platform)." ([Hunter 2019:21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=7))

"The success of NT Live—which renders theatre on cinema screens, separate from the place and often the moment of its production, and always removed from proximity to the bodies of the actors and technicians who enact it—demonstrates liveness to be less theatre's ontology than its brand. Theatre critic Michael Billington, in an observation prompted not by a live broadcast screening but a recording of Ibsen's Ghosts screened at the Almeida, proclaimed that it was time "to stop pretending that theatre can't be captured on screen . . . that it offers an unreproducible event." Billington notes that the recording, made by Digital Theatre, was filmed over three evenings' performances and never existed as a simultaneous broadcast, suggesting that what was "captured" in this case might have been less an acceptable degree or facsimile of liveness than a theatricality that could withstand the abatement of the live via a fairly conventional recording and editing process." ([Hunter 2019:22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=8))

_You lose points for quoting Billington ([note on p.22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=8))_

"Moreover, despite the innovation apparent in the broadcast process developed by the NT, it **does so for the most part using conventional and even relatively conservative theatrical productions with a blue-ribbon pedigree**. The works translated to the digital by NT Live and Live from Stratford do not speak to liveness and its relationship to the theatre from an aspiration toward intermedial experimentation,7 but for the most part sit squarely in the traditional realm of theatrical convention, demonstrating the marginality of liveness to theatre from within the heart of its orthodoxy." ([Hunter 2019:22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=8))

_Interesting point. Most works for NT live are kind of boring ([note on p.22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=8))_

"ly for those unused to the theatrical convention of soliloquy, the shot works as a kind of primer or guide, informing the broadcast audience of its practical use and instructing them on how it is to be received—for example, as the customary exteriorizing of an internal state described by Godwin." ([Hunter 2019:23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=9))

"At the same time, the masterful handling of sound, overseen by sound supervisor Andy Rose, emphasizes traditional vocal production for the stage: not only is Essiedu's delivery not rendered filmic in the broadcast, but the balance struck between intimate sound (from the microphone he wears) and the ambient sound picked up by a grid of microphones hung above the stage managed to communicate something very familiar about the specific effects of a trained voice vibrating in the open space of a theatre" ([Hunter 2019:23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=9))

"My point is not that the crew's skill makes the broadcast sound "just like" the staged production; rather, I suggest that the elements that broadcast crews endeavor to preserve, such as the particular qualities of actors' vocal production, indicate aspects of theatrical stage production understood as key to its translation to a new form, thereby effectively emphasizing, clarifying, or perhaps most importantly reifying the properties that qualify as constitutive of theatrical production. Bay-Cheng has pointed out the necessity of recognizing recordings of performance not as "transparent . . . windows to the performance itself," but as "the distortion of that performance" (2007, 39, 4" ([Hunter 2019:23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=9))

"It is something of a commonplace to suggest that broadcast audiences who see stage actors in relative close-up will witness their performances in greater detail, but what is at stake in the broadcasts' translation is not merely more of something that the theatre audience can already/also access; it is instead a kind of supplemental valence of direction and instruction that is capable of suggesting what makes theatre theatre. The broadcasts define a certain theatrical propriety not only in the sense that audiences (and for that matter performers) execute their roles in accordance with established behavioral norms, but in that they define what is right and proper for theatre, what texts, techniques, aesthetics, and performing bodies are representative of it." ([Hunter 2019:24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=10))

"Many shots offer perspectives on the layout of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre: crane shots move through the depth of its thrust stage, working through three-dimensional space even as the video produced tends to provide a compressed representation of stage space; others feature audience members and their proximity to performers, including the audience's visible and audible reactions to performers on the stage. The inclusion of these effectively and strategically communicates to a broadcast audience specific elements and relationships that constitute theatrical stage work, which are then thrown into sharp relief by their presentation in a traditionally cinematic form and venue. In addition, the broadcast is careful to include the conventions that open and conclude the production: the moments that the lights come down and the audience quiets, and the bringing up of stage lights and the applause that follows the end of the play. In the RSC's broadcast of Hamlet, the translation of scene changes appears as careful and detailed as that of the scene work itself, suggesting the significance and possibility of the liminal space between scenes, including the importance of light and sound to such transitions, and elucidating the making and unmaking of the playing space for the broadcast audience." ([Hunter 2019:24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=10))

"The digital translation exists not only as a record of the production, but of how it ought to be watched. Digital translations of theatre comprise a kind of pedagogy, both in their foregrounding of practices special to and constitutive of the theatre and their insistence on where audience attention belongs." ([Hunter 2019:25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=11))

"When digital translations are cast as documents that inevitably fail to fully capture or represent or be the original theatrical event, they may seem disappointing and disingenuous, but read as evidence of the affinities, priorities, and expectations attached to theatre and its reception—evidence that simultaneously functions prescriptively—they reveal themselves as quite potent in their power to propagate, inflect, and shape those same priorities and expectations. That includes wielding significant power to suggest who should do theatre and what is worth watching, inevitably implied by which companies dominate the market for digital translations, which productions merit translation, and which theatrical performers reach cinema screens." ([Hunter 2019:25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=11))

"Digital translations provide instruction as well as (or in the form of) access, especially to the extent that they imply that the chief identifying or constitutive characteristics of theatre—that is, how we know we are not making a movie—may not be whatever gestures toward liveness they offer, but rather the peculiarly theatrical practices, virtuosic performers, and canonical texts that those translations pointedly place on display. To date, the implicit didacticism of cinema broadcasts and other translations of staged theatre to the digital appears to be poised to work rather conservatively, preserving many long-standing norms by which we recognize theatre as itself. However, they offer a means by which theatre's constitutive practices might be re-defined as well as enshrined, potentially shifting and enlarging theatre's domain, as digital translations already have in their decoupling of theatre from disappearance and the embodied co-presence of actor and audience" ([Hunter 2019:25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34AU28NJ?page=11))
