# Autographic vs allographic

Autographic:
\* Film (sort of)
\* Painting
\* Sculpture
\* Writing
\* Recorded Music

Allographic:
\* Theatre
\* Dance
\* Live Music

As you'll see, music is in a weird liminal space, living between two worlds.

\==**Nelson Goodman in â€˜Languages of Artâ€™: autographic (identified with handwork) vs allographic (re-created in performance)**==
