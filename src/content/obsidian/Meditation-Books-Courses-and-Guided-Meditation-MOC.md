* **[Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha](https://www.mctb.org/mctb2/preface-to-the-second-edition/)** by [Daniel Ingram](http://integrateddaniel.info/) (free online, also available in [print](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4129848-mastering-the-core-teachings-of-the-buddha)). Also see the **[Dharma Overground forums](http://www.dharmaoverground.org/)**.
* **[Our Pristine Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Our-Pristine-Mind-Practical-Unconditional/dp/1611803276)** by [Orgyen Chowang Rinpoche](https://pristinemind.org/about-us/orgyen-chowang-rinpoche/) is a pragmatic and secular guide to Dzogchen specifically written for Westerners. Enlightenment is clearly defined and the stages of awakening as understood in Dzogchen are thoroughly explained in plain language. This is a recommended resource for anyone interested in an "awareness-based" approach to Awakening.
* **[Right Concentration](https://www.amazon.com/Right-Concentration-Practical-Guide-Jhanas/dp/1611802695)** by [Leigh Brasington](http://leighb.com/), an accessable and comprehensive guide to jhāna practice. Jhāna (meditative absorption) is sometimes described as one of the two wings of awakening, the other being insight practice. See also the [book's website](http://rc.leighb.com/index.html), which contains [supplementary material](http://rc.leighb.com/more/index.html).
