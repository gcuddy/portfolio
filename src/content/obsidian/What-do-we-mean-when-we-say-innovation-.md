# What do we mean when we say innovation? ⫝

"Innovation" is a word thrown around a lot in Silicon Valley. It seems to be an end goal --- or a way *through*? --- for many companies and tech evangelizers.

But what do we actually mean by the word Innovate/Innovative/Innovation? That's not too clear. It generally applies to a very specific realm of technology, particularly communications technology; innovation as currently conceived generally does not make people's lives demonstrably better.

Western innovation seems to have a few overriding origins/influences:

## Christianity

Peter Thiel-influenced thought of Silicon Valley is deeply rooted in a literalized interpretation of Christianity's conception of time, especially versus Eastern conceptions of time. Christian thought sees time moving in a linear fashion: from the Garden of Eden to the Kingdom of Heaven. Time marches forward, and "innovation" is a march towards heaven.

There is a history of racist Western thought that sees Eastern religion --- Taoism, Buddhism, etc. --- as sleepy and not progress-oriented: "the universe is already perfect" so there's no need for innovation, only the need to maintain balance.

* [ ] add in examples why that's racist

## Industrial Revolution

Of course, much of modern capitalism stems back to the Industrial Revolution. This is when modern engineering culture started to take place, with technology being the output. But it was capitalists, company owners who actually saw the profits of this innovation. (Wang)

## Manifest Destiny

These create a culture that sees the White Male as being the only one capable of innovation in the United States.

Writes Wang in *Blockchain Chicken Farm*:

> In the United States, Asians are rarely seen as innovative. Because, after all, to be innovative is to be bold, daring, and brash. Within popular tech discourse, these qualities are more often ascribed to Western white men—heroic inventors with astonishing capacities, like John Galt from Atlas Shrugged.

She points to the possibility of [[Shanzhai]], which stereotypically is seen as what we could call "knock-off" versions of popular products. But that is an extremely limited view. Shanzhai is collaborative and creative. Writes Wang:

> Shanzhai holds the power to decolonize technology. For so long, technology expertise was held by a small circle, a technical elite. “Technology transfer” is the process that many development experts describe, the seeding of tech products, software, assistance, and advice from the metropolitan United States to places like China, Kenya, and even rural America. These projects have had mixed success, often leaving communities dependent on proprietary technology. But in order for technology absorption to happen, such places need the ecosystem, tools, and knowledge to begin to create their own products, tailored to their contexts. **Shanzhai pushes the boundaries of what we currently think of as innovation and argues for the right not only to use a device or software but also to collaboratively alter, change, and reclaim it—a shanzhai economy instead of an innovation economy**.

She continues:

> If innovation casts the spell of capitalism, in this mountain stronghold, I see shanzhai as a verb, used to cast a different kind of spell. To shanzhai. To turn protocols into practices that bind us together rather than centralize authority. To turn back the worship of scale and renew our commitments to care. I think back to the words I heard when I was a kid, the other magical phrase, Made in China, and the dismissive tone in the man’s voice. Barometers of success and innovation are invented by those with money, turning engagement into the surface-level interactions of informed users, rather than the deeper actions that tackle structural, social change by invested citizens willing to hold long village meetings. Entire entrepreneurship programs exist, funded by VCs, designed to foster what VCs see as the core values of innovation. Instead of continuing to accept success and innovation as empty containers, I propose new measures, understanding our world through shanzhai, through the ability to care, maintain, renew, and deepen commitments.
