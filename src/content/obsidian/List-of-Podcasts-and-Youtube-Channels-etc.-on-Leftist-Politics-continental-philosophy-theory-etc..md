Hi, I'm Jonas Čeika. I make video essays on continental philosophy and leftist politics, often applying philosophical concepts to media and pop culture to make them easier to grasp. Thank you for watching!  
  
My book on Marx and Nietzsche, is out on Repeater Books: https://repeaterbooks.com/product/how-to-philosophize-with-a-hammer-and-sickle/
