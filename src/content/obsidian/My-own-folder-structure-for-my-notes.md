#2022/05/07 2022-05-07-173542

Inspired by Zylstra (but also basb):

* Inbox/Ideas
* Notes
* Projects
* Sources
* Areas
* Bins

What about an Archive?

* Projects
  * Project Folders/Notes that link to Areas
* Areas
* Inbox - catch all
  * Reading Inbox?
  * Writing Inbox? Still unsure how to differentiate these
* Ideas ?
  * this would be a place for actionable ideas, that Zylstra talks about [[100 Days in Obsidian Pt 2 Hierarchy and Logs – Interdependent Thoughts]]
* Evergreens? Notes?
  * Maybe just one catchall Notes folder
  * Zylstra uses one for conceptual notes he calles Notions, differentiates that from more referential/factoid style notes (which are kind of like lit notes no?)
* Notes/Lit notes/factoid notes/resources
* Sources - for Clippings, all Source Notes?
  * Zylstra differentiates these all - newclippings etc, and deltes them sometimes from this folder, but i think better to extract ideas and then move them to sep notes and leave original here -  right? Davecan does something like this, although I believe each source note has its own folder and then lit notes live in that folder as well?
* z - Bins / Templates / meta --?
  * images place, etc.

But also consider rsms: breadth over depth

File naming: Notions/Evergreens are timestamped, as are literature notes, though I'm not sure entirely why lol

And ACCESS from Milo (though I don't fully know what it means lol)

+Encounters (basically an inbox)
Atlas (for MOCs, Dataview scopes, etc - nice idea)
Extras (? is this like his bin of old? i don't understand)
Calendar (like journal/timestamps?)
Cards (definitely don't understand this — a kanban? No actually I think it's just the place for Notes. Like Index Cards. That's my guess.)
Spaces (interesting combo of Projects/Areas and Sparky's idea of Roles — basically you have a "Life" space e.g. and then deploy MAPS folder structure lol - MOCS, Areas, Projects, Support Notes)

Honestly I'm surprised at Nick's folder structure, as it seems *very* subfolder oriented. Not really that simple at all.

#note/boat

Right now it consists of possibly:

* Vault root
  * Inbox ??
  * Reading Inbox
  * Actions
  * Areas
  * Projects
  * Evergreens/Notes
  * Sources
  * Archive
  * Journal/Timeline
  * Planning
  * Archive
  * Bins
    * Meta

Started with [[PARA]] and ended up with a [[Zettelkasten]]-PARA hybrid.
