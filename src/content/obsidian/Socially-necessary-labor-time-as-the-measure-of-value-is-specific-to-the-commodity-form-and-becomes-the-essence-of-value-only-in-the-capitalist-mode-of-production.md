> The most fatal mistake in reading Marxâ€”a mistake as prevalent among his followers as among his criticsâ€”is to think that he accepts a general labor theory of value, which holds that labor is the necessary source of all social wealth. Such a theory was first formulated by the classical political economists Adam Smith and David Ricardo and supposedly further developed by Marx. For Smith and Ricardo, labor as the essential measure of value is a transhistorical fact. They assume that labor has always been and will always be the source of social wealth. ==For Marx, by contrast, socially necessary labor time as the measure of value is specific to the commodity form and becomes the essence of value only in the capitalist mode of production==. ==Labor time as the measure of value is not transhistorically necessary but the historically specific essence of capitalism, which is contradictory and can be overcome==.
