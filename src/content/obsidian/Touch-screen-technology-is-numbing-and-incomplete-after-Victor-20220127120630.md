"Pictures Under Glass", as Victor puts it, is not a sufficient interaction paradigm â€” because it denies our hands from actually interacting with things like they do in the real world. Touching cold glass is totally different than anything we manipulate in the real world.

Glass is also two-dimensional. Everything we interact with using our hands is three-dimensional. For this technology to be the future means a numbing quality to our senses.

Vibration and "3D touch" may help with this, and seem directly inspired by Victor's ideas here (he mentions them in passing).

> ==Pictures Under Glass is an interaction paradigm of permanent numbness==. It's a Novocaine drip to the wrist. It denies our hands what they do best. And yet, it's the star player in every Vision Of The Future.
