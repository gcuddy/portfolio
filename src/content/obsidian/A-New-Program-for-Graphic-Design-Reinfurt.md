188 Sugimoto LA Cinema image - connect with narrative time, [[Time]], [[art and time]] [[Hiroshi Sugimoto Cinema Series]]
> It is from a series called *Theatres* in which he set up his camera in a cinema and left the lens open for the full running time of a film. This picture was made south of San Francisco in 1993. Sugimoto describes that =="to watch a two-hour movie is simply to look at 172,800 photographic afterimages."== So what you see in his image is every photograph in the film passing by at 24  frames per second and collapsed into one composite white rectangle [↓]. This still picture contains the entire two hours, and if only you could change the speed of your eyes, you might even be able watch it. The camera also records the traces of everything else that happens in the meantime — in this case, planes taking off from and landing at San Francisco International Airport.
