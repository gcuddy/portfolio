# Black Reconstruction in America: An Essay Toward A History of the Part Which Black Folk Played in the Attempt to Reconstruct Democracy in America, 1860-1880

## Notes

Critical passage:

>As slavery grew to a system and the Cotton Kingdom began to expand into .imperial white domination, a free Negro was a contra­ diction, a threat and a menace. As a thief and a vagabond, he threat­ ened society; but as an educated property holder, a successful mechanic or even professional man, he more than threatened slavery. He con­ tradicted and undermined it. He must not be. He must be suppressed, enslaved, colonized. And nothing so bad could be said about him that did not easily appear as true to slaveholders. (7)
