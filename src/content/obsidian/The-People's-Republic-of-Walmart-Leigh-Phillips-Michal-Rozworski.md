## Highlights
- “I pay low wages,” said founder Sam Walton. “I can take advantage of that. We’re going to be successful, but the basis is a very low-wage, low-benefit model of employment.” ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=76))
- If only Walmart’s operational efficiency, its logistical genius, its architecture of agile economic planning could be captured and transformed by those who aim toward a more egalitarian, liberatory society! ([Location 84](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=84))
    - mw:: nervous this book is going to be overly statist or DSA-y or not acknowledge the revaluation that Hagglund argues for
- ==the set of all useful things and the set of all profitable things are not in perfect correspondence==. If something is profitable, even if it is not useful or is even harmful, someone will continue producing it so long as the market is left to its own devices. ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=96))
    - mw:: this is the key point - capitalism motivated solely by profit. what’s “good” is NOT necessarily incentivized
    - connection:: [[the primary value of capitalism is profit]]
- ==Fossil fuels are a contemporary example of this irremediable, critical flaw==. Wonderful though they have been due to their energy density and portability—freeing us energetically from the caprices of Mother Nature, who may or may not blow windmills or turn waterwheels when we want her to—we now know that the greenhouse gases emitted by fossil fuel combustion will rapidly shift the planet away from an average temperature that has remained optimal for human flourishing since the last ice age. ([Location 98](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=98))
    - mw:: Right. Nice contectualizarion here
    - connection:: [[Climate change is caused by profits and capital, not people]]
	    - -> :: [[Fossil Fuel’s Downfall Could Be America’s Too by Adam Tooze]]
	    - ->:: [[Fossil fuels are a key example of how capitalism values profit above all]]
- Conversely, if something is useful but unprofitable, it will not be produced. In the United States, for instance, where there is no universal public healthcare system, healthcare for all would be wonderfully useful. But because it is not profitable, it is not produced. High-speed internet in rural areas is not profitable, so private telecommunications companies are loathe to provide it there, preferring instead to cherry-pick profitable population-dense neighborhoods. ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=110))
    - mw:: yes. we don’t care for each other

	- [[Capitalism artificially reduces usefulness]]
- As a 2008 “call to arms” paper from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) put it, “[Antibiotics] are less desirable to drug companies and venture capitalists because they are more successful than other drugs.” Antibiotics are successful if they kill off an infection, at which point—days or weeks, or at most months, later—the patient stops taking the drug. For chronic diseases, however, patients may have to take their medicine every day, sometimes for the rest of their lives. Thus, the paper concluded, it is long-term therapy—not cures—that drives interest in drug development. ([Location 120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=120))

- Beyond this one sector, we might note that basic research in any field—that blue-sky stuff, where scientists are led by simple curiosity and have no expectation of developing any marketable product, and which is the basis of technologies and medicines that later turn out to be very marketable indeed—simply cannot be done by the private sector. This type of research is extremely expensive but makes no guarantee of any return on such spending. Such research thus is almost entirely a phenomenon characteristic of public institutions or private charities rather than market actors. Similarly, it was not the market that got us to the moon, but a grand public-sector enterprise called NASA. ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=128))
- Past generations have fought to expand the realm of freedom—to ensure all adult humans have the same rights and to ensure that any new capabilities delivered through technological advance are to be made available to all. And if we are to continue this battle to correct the titanic, manifest unfairness of the way things are, we must therefore wage a struggle over which method for the allocation of things we want as a society. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=145))
## New highlights added [[2023-06-06]] at 11:51 AM
- Nevertheless, the free(-ish) market is a necessary condition for capitalism—one that, as a method of allocation, leads to growing inequality via disparities in the distribution of income. Market interactions inevitably produce winners and losers, leading to concentrations of wealth. Over time, these disparities grow, a product of these same market interactions. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=160))
- Real markets are a far cry from this idealized fairy tale: companies regularly collude to keep out competitors, large corporations constantly lobby for government subsidies, and it is the norm that a few big players dominate entire product categories and set prices. One market in particular—the labor market—needed centuries of coercion and dispossession to turn peasants and farmers into workers willing to sell their labor for a wage. Frequently, supply and demand do not reach equilibrium; as a result, the market system regularly leads to crises of overproduction, which in turn provoke recessions and depressions, with wrenching consequences for millions of people. ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=163))
- Even arch-capitalist America is home not only to Walmart and Amazon, but also to the Pentagon: in spite of being incredibly destructive, the US Department of Defense is the single-largest employer in the world, and a centrally planned public sector operation. In fact, almost all countries are mixed economies that include various combinations of markets and planning. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=176))
    - mw:: One distinction I want to tease out in my mind is public sectors and the state - those are inextricably linked, no?
- Indeed, planning has accompanied human societies as long as they have existed. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=179))
    - mw:: sure - what exactly do we mean by planning tho? want to cross compare this claim somewhat with graeber and wengrow’s book
- Unlike the localized gift-exchange economy of prehistory, ancient Mesopotamia saw systems of centralized redistribution that mimic today’s welfare states: taxes and levies in, transfers of goods and services out. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=185))
    - mw:: In a way this is kind of an interesting question for a utopian society: do we go back to hunger gatherer tribes (ala what anarchists seem to advocate on some level) or something more reminiscent of e.g. what’s presented here
- In an oft-repeated passage from The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith wrote that “the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another” led to the division of labor, the invention of money and greater economic complexity. This bit of make-believe has been passed down for centuries and can still be found in most introductory economics textbooks. The problem with this intriguing tale is that it is false. Specialization developed within large household compounds where there was no internal exchange; heads of households distributed total household production among members—they planned. Money, on the other hand, arose largely as a tool for traders, mercenaries and others to settle debts with the ancient temples. As economic complexity grew, money was more widely adopted as a means of keeping track of taxes and other major transactions. ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=188))
- This is not to say there was some Arcadia of central planning at this time, any more than it is accurate to describe hunter-gatherer society as some peaceful egalitarian Eden. The planning of the ancients was not only rudimentary and partial; it was also far from being a rational way of securing the shared benefit of all. Indeed, ancient planning was at the service of an economic system created for the benefit of a small coterie of elites who were motivated to maintain their wealth and power. Sound familiar? ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=200))
- As the political debate becomes more polarized, young people on the whole, even in the Anglo-American center of the capitalist order, now view socialism more favorably than they do capitalism. ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=207))
    - mw:: source?
- There is not only a crying need for us to talk about what that alternative to the market would be, but also a great deal of confusion about what planning is and its history. To take one example: China appears to be the last man standing in the global economy; its growth rates, even if they have declined recently from eye popping to merely gobsmacking, have been achieved through an admixture of free market mechanisms and very heavy shepherding by authoritarian central planners. It seems even some members of the ascendant bourgeoisie in that country believe that Mao’s economic planning was less mistaken than premature. A 2018 Financial Times feature describes Jack Ma, founder of the Chinese e-commerce colossus Alibaba Group, as part of a growing movement in the People’s Republic who argue that “the fatal flaw of state planning was simply that planners did not have enough information to make good decisions.” ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=212))
- Above all, our goal with this brief text is simply to flag a rarely recognized, yet obvious, fact that in some sense makes the “calculation debate” anachronistic: it is already the case that great swaths of the global economy exist outside the market and are planned. Walmart is a prime example. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=235))
- The caveat is that such vast, centrally planned enterprises—and they are so vast that we should really call them centrally planned economies—are not planned in any democratic fashion. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=238))
    - mw:: lol this is a massive caveat
- When we say we want an equal society, what we’re fighting for is democratic planning. There is no machine that can simply be taken over, run by new operators but otherwise left unchanged; but there is a foundation of planning that a more just society could surely take up and make its own. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=240))
    - mw:: what does democratic planning actually look like? beyond just participatory budgeting?
- Since the demise of post-war technological optimism in the ’70s, Jameson finds that the once robust tradition of utopian thinking has waned considerably; the bare handful of fresh utopias that he identifies as having emerged—be it cyberpunk aesthetics or the cheerleading for corporate-led globalization—appear wholly unimaginative in comparison to their promethean and modernist predecessors, who did not content themselves to merely transform realms of communication and information the way contemporary utopians might. These are mere sectoral concerns, he says, rather than grander, society-wide ambitions; they are not comprehensive utopias. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=247))
    - mw:: yes, we need more utopias! jameson’s is fundamentally flawed (universal army is not the path) but the insight is good. 
      worth noting dan wang has also written this and there’s some grumbling from capitalists about this as well
- Bits of a better world that we could exploit are already sprouting up yet no one seems to have noticed them. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=253))
    - mw:: emancipatory potential if technology
- Jameson wonders whether we might in fact be missing a trick about this transcontinental marvel of planning and logistics: The literary utopists have scarcely kept pace with the businessmen in the process of imagination and construction … ignoring a global infrastructural deployment in which, from this quite different perspective, the Walmart celebrated by Friedman becomes the very anticipatory prototype of some new form of socialism for which the reproach of centralization now proves historically misplaced and irrelevant. It is in any case certainly a revolutionary reorganization of capitalist production, and some acknowledgment such as “Waltonism” or “Walmartification” would be a more appropriate name for this new stage. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=255))
    - mw:: also immense hierarchical structures within walmart lol even to. a type of monarchy
- Walmart is “the shape of a Utopian future looming through the mist, which we must seize as an opportunity to exercise the Utopian imagination more fully, rather than an occasion for moralizing judgments or regressive nostalgia.” ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=265))
    - mw:: really struggling to buy this. otoh i do get some fascination with the whole machine especially with something like apple
- Since the neoliberal revolution of the 1970s and its acceleration following the end of the Cold War, economic planning at scale has been widely derided from right to center-left, and planned endeavors such as public healthcare have been under attack from marketization in most countries. In most jurisdictions, the electricity systems that were once in public hands have long since been privatized; therefore governments committed to efforts to decarbonize electricity companies have had little choice but to employ market mechanisms such as emissions trading or carbon taxation, rather than reducing greenhouse gas emissions via democratic fiat—that is, simply ordering the electricity provider to switch to non-emitting fuel sources. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=284))
- “the state” and “planning” are far from synonymous. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=294))
    - mw:: how?
- For much of social democracy in the twenty-first century, beliefs follow from policies, rather than policies from beliefs. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=298))
- Why has infrastructure crumbled and innovation stalled? Why can’t the market resolve what is perhaps the greatest threat to modernity, microbial resistance to antibiotics—a situation that risks casting medicine back to the Victorian era—whereas a public sector effort likely could? And why can’t the market, left to its own devices, meet the civilizationally existential challenge of climate change? ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=314))
    - mw:: all these questions are important and also don't take into account spiritual freedom
- Therefore, any economy the size of an entire country that tried to replace the myriad decisions from the multitude of sovereign consumers with the plans of bureaucrats working from incorrigibly flawed data would regularly produce vast, chasm-like mismatches between what is demanded and what is supplied. These inefficiencies would result in such social and economic barbarities—shortages, starvation, frustration and chaos—that even if one accepts the inevitability of inequalities and attendant myriad other horrors of capitalism, the market will still appear benign by comparison. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=370))
    - mw:: argument from von Mises vs Neurath
- Mises’s argument in his 1920 essay, later developed through a series of books, is described to this day by his acolytes as his masterpiece. And not without reason: it is perhaps the strongest argument ever mounted against the idea of socialism. How, indeed, could we replace prices with planning boards? And isn’t socialism supposed to be direct rule by the workers, rather than a replacement of unelected bosses with remote bureaucrats? If centralized by bureaucrats, how could all that information be gathered? And if decentralized, how could all those millions (and globally, billions) of workers democratically coordinate production decisions? ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=378))
- Neurath, for his part, insisted that prices in the market, as descriptors for behavior in an economy, are no less corrupted by this loss of fidelity because they fail to capture sufficient information on the material circumstances of citizens and fail to describe adequately all the costs or benefits of actions. In a system with market-based provision of healthcare, for instance, price does not describe information on inability to access healthcare, just as price does not reflect the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the average temperature of the planet. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=382))
    - mw:: yes because primary driver is fundamentally profit above everything else. not actual freedom and liberation
- The stalemate could even be tweeted in less than 140 characters: “What about data imperfections leading to shortages?” “Oh yeah? Well what about data imperfections leading to injustices?” ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=389))
- Walmart is perhaps the best evidence we have that while planning appears not to work in Mises’s theory, it certainly does in practice. And then some. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=396))
- Today, it employs more workers than any other private firm; if we include state enterprises in our ranking, it is the world’s third-largest employer after the US Department of Defense and the People’s Liberation Army. If it were a country—let’s call it the People’s Republic of Walmart—its economy would be roughly the size of a Sweden or a Switzerland. Using the 2015 World Bank country-by-country comparison of purchasing-power parity GDP, we could place it as the 38th largest economy in the world. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=400))
- It would be far too expensive in terms of labor costs for one tiny store to be able to maintain a commercial relationship with thousands of record labels, and vice versa; but that store can have a relationship with, say, five distributors, each of whom have a relationship with, say, a hundred labels. The use of distributors also minimizes inventory costs while maximizing the variety that a store can offer, at the same time offering everyone along the supply chain a more accurate knowledge of demand. So while your local shop may not carry albums from Hello Kitty Pencil Case Records, via the banal magic of distributors, your tiny local shop will have a relationship with more record labels than they otherwise could. ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=429))
- “Continuous replenishment” is a bit of a misnomer, as the system actually provides merely very frequent restocking (from the supplier to the distributor and thence the retailer), in which the decision on the amount and the timing of replenishment lies with the supplier, not the retailer. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=437))
- Thus, planning, and above all trust, openness and cooperation along the supply chain—rather than competition—are fundamental to continuous replacement. This is not the “kumbaya” analysis of two socialist writers; even the most hard-hearted commerce researchers and company directors argue that a prerequisite of successful supply chain management is that all participants in the chain recognize that they all will gain more by cooperating as a trusting, information-sharing whole than they will as competitors. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=465))
- While there are indeed financial transactions within the supply chain, resource allocation among Walmart’s vast network of global suppliers, warehouses and retail stores is regularly described by business analysts as more akin to behaving like a single firm. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=480))
- “Organizations need a holistic strategy,” according to the former head of the DieHard battery unit, Erik Rosenstrauch. Indeed they do. But is not society as a whole an organization? Is this lesson any less true for the global economy than it is for Sears? To take just one example: the continued combustion of coal, oil and gas may be a disaster for our species as a whole, but so long as it remains profitable for some of Eddie’s “divisions,” those responsible for extracting and processing fossil fuels, these will continue to act in a way that serves their particular interests, the rest of the company—or in this case the rest of society—be damned. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=561))
    - mw:: this broad, holistic strategy is maybe the case for something resembling socialism vs federated anarchism - or at least broad scaled cooperation, not just roving autonomous zones
- In the face of all this evidence, Lampert is, however, unrepentant, proclaiming, “Decentralised systems and structures work better than centralised ones because they produce better information over time.” For him, the battles between divisions within Sears can only be a good thing. According to spokesman Steve Braithwaite, “Clashes for resources are a product of competition and advocacy, things that were sorely lacking before and are lacking in socialist economies.” ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=566))
- Thus, the most ardent advocates of the free market—the captains of industry—prefer not to employ market-based allocation within their own organizations. ([Location 574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=574))
    - mw:: hm. not sure this is a checkmate

> The market economy is not only rife with planning, but with authoritarian planning that concentrates economic decision making in the hands of wealth owners and keeps workers in line. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=612))

---

> Open nearly any introductory economics textbook, however, and the world appears as a nearly boundless realm of choice. Among the paeans to freedom and to the spontaneous efficiency of markets, few words even graze the everyday planning that goes on within the four walls of the firm. Fewer, still, name it as coercive. Planning under capitalism is about making people do things—without their input and not necessarily in their interest. At best, economists will bring up planning in order to ridicule it, failing, or refusing, to grasp its centrality even in a market system. Coase’s seemingly naive questions start us on a path toward a corrective. ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=615))

> However, Smith himself understood that real economies involve all manner of nonmarket interactions—even the phrase “invisible hand” makes but a single appearance in his Wealth of Nations. Smith, for example, assumed that factory owners would scheme together—that is, plan—to keep wages low. Later economists would concentrate only on the first half of his story: that the market system produces order out of chaos, all on its own.

Demand meets supply when the price falls—at least that’s what happens in theory. In reality, the extra pants can end up in landfills, and H&M’s production for next season can end up moving somewhere with lower wages to make ever lower prices possible.

> market socialism. The two thinkers complemented each other so well that the idea that socialist planning could replicate capitalist efficiency came to be called the Lange-Lerner theorem. Mimicking parts of the theory of capitalism, Lange and Lerner wanted to show that planning could meet and even exceed capitalism’s own measures for squeezing the most human satisfaction out of scarce resources. ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=693))

---

> Such defeatism alarmed another Austrian economist, Friedrich von Hayek, who, following in the footsteps of Mises, was determined to prove Lange wrong. Hayek is better known today as the godfather of neoliberalism, the pro-market ideology that has come to dominate government policy around much of the world, the first incarnation of which is best exemplified by the administrations of Margaret Thatcher in the UK and Ronald Reagan in the United States during the 1980s. Hayek was explicit about wanting ideological regime change. The postwar welfare state truce between capital and labor had barely been installed when Hayek joined a small group of right-wing radicals to found the Mont Pelerin Society in 1944—a free market think tank before its time. It was integral to their task of reshaping ideology that they have at the ready a rebuke to Lange, Lerner and the other socialists who looked to have the upper hand.

> Buying and selling may not generate technical and scientific knowledge, but it still creates all that knowledge of “time and place” that is instrumental to making efficient production and distribution decisions. Hayek argued that the problem for planners was not in the “how”—the equations to use—but in the “what”—the data that goes into the equations. The copious information planners need is unavailable before markets work their magic. Decentralization creates coordination: only the market can bring together the information that is normally isolated in the heads of different individuals.

> What he is after is not so much freedom for people, but rather freedom for information and money—those two central lubricants of market activity. Human beings, after all, are not capable of democratically coordinating complex systems, so they must therefore submit themselves to the dictates of the market, onboarding its anonymous decisions no matter how profound the social costs it creates. The argument against planning clearly hinges on Hayek’s ideological commitments ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=734))

> Other mechanisms “align incentives”—for example, trying to ensure that workers internalize and act in accord with the goals of managers or ensure that managers internalize and act in accord with the goals of stock owners. Mechanism design is just one more example showing that the free market also has to be planned. Real-world markets must be consciously made and remade.

---

> Workers are brought together under the quite literally despotic rule of managers within businesses (a business is not a democracy) because, fundamentally, we have no other choice. Even in those workplaces where management has offered workers a modicum of control over decision making, outside of strong union representation, this gift of freedom and democracy is offered (and withdrawn) at the pleasure of management.

> Shirking, however, is a very rational response for someone who has little or no say over their work, often has no deeper sense of collective responsibility and knows that the profit from what they do ends up in someone else’s pocket. Shirking is not an innate tendency toward laziness, but rather the way people are under capitalism. ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=811))

> Rather than being overrun by unthinking self-interest, shared resources were in reality often governed by complex sets of social rules established over time. Ostrom studied actual shared pasture land in Swiss alpine villages and found it had been preserved for common use for over 500 years. Based on this and other case studies, Ostrom went on to identify conditions that helped protect common resources—among them, participation in decision making by users of the resources, the capacity for monitoring usage, meaningful social sanctions and conflict-resolution mechanisms.

> Uber’s drivers, on the other hand, are poorly-paid “contractors.” No longer classified as workers (except in the UK where courts reinstated their rights as workers), they can make below minimum wage and have few labor rights. As with more and more workers in a range of sectors, they are under constant, nigh on panoptical, surveillance via data. Uber uses a five-star driver rating system in which drivers must maintain an average rating of 4.6 stars to keep driving for the company. Uber can “suggest” certain norms for its drivers to follow (how much to smile, what kind of extra services to offer, and so on), but in reality it is the risk of even one bad rating that quickly prods them to fall into line. Yet there is no top-down rule; when businesses can constantly collect and analyze information, strict management happens from the bottom up. Uber’s business model is to use the economics of information to do more than just sell ad space. The company’s ability to make people do things without telling them explicitly is not unique and is but a refinement of capitalism’s ability to make people complicit in their own unfreedom—a refinement made possible by a greater amount of and greater control over information.

Excellent point about control of information enforcing despotic rule from the bottom up

> On the other hand, rather than the herald of dystopian workplaces everywhere, Uber is also a natural candidate for a worker co-op. All that Uber provides, after all, is an app; the company is nothing but a middleman. A cooperatively owned network of drivers using a similar app could set pay rates and work rules democratically, in the here and now. A drivers’ co-op would be far superior to the venture capital–fueled behemoth we have today, even if this is a form of enterprise that, while introducing more workplace democracy than is normally possible under capitalism in the short run, is still subject to the same profit-seeking imperatives as any firm within capitalism—imperatives that will prompt self-exploitation in order to compete with other enterprises, thus ultimately undermining these very same democratic impulses.

Nice idea here for uber as worker co-op - and yes app/engineeeing plays a role there

> Similarly, social networks could be run as public utilities rather than as private monopolies—remember that we created public electricity or water works after the failures of nineteenth-century robber baron capitalism. One of the big questions of the twenty-first century will be, who owns and controls the data that is quickly becoming a key economic resource? Will it be the fuel for democratic planning, or instead for a new more authoritarian capitalism? ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=866))

> Planning is not only possible, but is already all around us, albeit in hierarchical and undemocratic forms. What a very different, democratic planning will look like is a question a new generation of progressive economists needs to begin today to discuss, debate and test through modeling.

this type of collective planning is reminiscent of Hagglund's arguments. I worry that centralized "planners" enforces a technocratic elite...

> “I pay low wages,” said founder Sam Walton. “I can take advantage of that. We’re going to be successful, but the basis is a very low-wage, low-benefit model of employment.” ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=76))

> the set of all useful things and the set of all profitable things are not in perfect correspondence. If something is profitable, even if it is not useful or is even harmful, someone will continue producing it so long as the market is left to its own devices.

this is the key point - capitalism motivated solely by profit. what’s “good” is NOT necessarily incentivized

> Fossil fuels are a contemporary example of this irremediable, critical flaw. Wonderful though they have been due to their energy density and portability—freeing us energetically from the caprices of Mother Nature, who may or may not blow windmills or turn waterwheels when we want her to—we now know that the greenhouse gases emitted by fossil fuel combustion will rapidly shift the planet away from an average temperature that has remained optimal for human flourishing since the last ice age.

Right. Nice contectualizarion here

> Conversely, if something is useful but unprofitable, it will not be produced. In the United States, for instance, where there is no universal public healthcare system, healthcare for all would be wonderfully useful. But because it is not profitable, it is not produced. High-speed internet in rural areas is not profitable, so private telecommunications companies are loathe to provide it there, preferring instead to cherry-pick profitable population-dense neighborhoods.

> As a 2008 “call to arms” paper from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) put it, “[Antibiotics] are less desirable to drug companies and venture capitalists because they are more successful than other drugs.” Antibiotics are successful if they kill off an infection, at which point—days or weeks, or at most months, later—the patient stops taking the drug. For chronic diseases, however, patients may have to take their medicine every day, sometimes for the rest of their lives. Thus, the paper concluded, it is long-term therapy—not cures—that drives interest in drug development. ([Location 120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=120))

> Beyond this one sector, we might note that basic research in any field—that blue-sky stuff, where scientists are led by simple curiosity and have no expectation of developing any marketable product, and which is the basis of technologies and medicines that later turn out to be very marketable indeed—simply cannot be done by the private sector. This type of research is extremely expensive but makes no guarantee of any return on such spending. Such research thus is almost entirely a phenomenon characteristic of public institutions or private charities rather than market actors. Similarly, it was not the market that got us to the moon, but a grand public-sector enterprise called NASA. ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=128))

> Past generations have fought to expand the realm of freedom—to ensure all adult humans have the same rights and to ensure that any new capabilities delivered through technological advance are to be made available to all. And if we are to continue this battle to correct the titanic, manifest unfairness of the way things are, we must therefore wage a struggle over which method for the allocation of things we want as a society. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=145))

---

> Nevertheless, the free(-ish) market is a necessary condition for capitalism—one that, as a method of allocation, leads to growing inequality via disparities in the distribution of income. Market interactions inevitably produce winners and losers, leading to concentrations of wealth. Over time, these disparities grow, a product of these same market interactions.

> Real markets are a far cry from this idealized fairy tale: companies regularly collude to keep out competitors, large corporations constantly lobby for government subsidies, and it is the norm that a few big players dominate entire product categories and set prices. One market in particular—the labor market—needed centuries of coercion and dispossession to turn peasants and farmers into workers willing to sell their labor for a wage. Frequently, supply and demand do not reach equilibrium; as a result, the market system regularly leads to crises of overproduction, which in turn provoke recessions and depressions, with wrenching consequences for millions of people.

> Even arch-capitalist America is home not only to Walmart and Amazon, but also to the Pentagon: in spite of being incredibly destructive, the US Department of Defense is the single-largest employer in the world, and a centrally planned public sector operation. In fact, almost all countries are mixed economies that include various combinations of markets and planning. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=176))

> Unlike the localized gift-exchange economy of prehistory, ancient Mesopotamia saw systems of centralized redistribution that mimic today’s welfare states: taxes and levies in, transfers of goods and services out. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=185))

In a way this is kind of an interesting question for a utopian society: do we go back to hunger gatherer tribes (ala what anarchists seem to advocate on some level) or something more reminiscent of e.g. what’s presented here

---

> In an oft-repeated passage from The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith wrote that “the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another” led to the division of labor, the invention of money and greater economic complexity. This bit of make-believe has been passed down for centuries and can still be found in most introductory economics textbooks. The problem with this intriguing tale is that it is false. Specialization developed within large household compounds where there was no internal exchange; heads of households distributed total household production among members—they planned. Money, on the other hand, arose largely as a tool for traders, mercenaries and others to settle debts with the ancient temples. As economic complexity grew, money was more widely adopted as a means of keeping track of taxes and other major transactions.

---

> This is not to say there was some Arcadia of central planning at this time, any more than it is accurate to describe hunter-gatherer society as some peaceful egalitarian Eden. The planning of the ancients was not only rudimentary and partial; it was also far from being a rational way of securing the shared benefit of all. Indeed, ancient planning was at the service of an economic system created for the benefit of a small coterie of elites who were motivated to maintain their wealth and power. Sound familiar?

> There is not only a crying need for us to talk about what that alternative to the market would be, but also a great deal of confusion about what planning is and its history. To take one example: China appears to be the last man standing in the global economy; its growth rates, even if they have declined recently from eye popping to merely gobsmacking, have been achieved through an admixture of free market mechanisms and very heavy shepherding by authoritarian central planners. It seems even some members of the ascendant bourgeoisie in that country believe that Mao’s economic planning was less mistaken than premature. A 2018 Financial Times feature describes Jack Ma, founder of the Chinese e-commerce colossus Alibaba Group, as part of a growing movement in the People’s Republic who argue that “the fatal flaw of state planning was simply that planners did not have enough information to make good decisions.” ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=212))

---

> Above all, our goal with this brief text is simply to flag a rarely recognized, yet obvious, fact that in some sense makes the “calculation debate” anachronistic: it is already the case that great swaths of the global economy exist outside the market and are planned. Walmart is a prime example. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=235))

> When we say we want an equal society, what we’re fighting for is democratic planning.

> Since the demise of post-war technological optimism in the ’70s, Jameson finds that the once robust tradition of utopian thinking has waned considerably; the bare handful of fresh utopias that he identifies as having emerged—be it cyberpunk aesthetics or the cheerleading for corporate-led globalization—appear wholly unimaginative in comparison to their promethean and modernist predecessors, who did not content themselves to merely transform realms of communication and information the way contemporary utopians might. These are mere sectoral concerns, he says, rather than grander, society-wide ambitions; they are not comprehensive utopias. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=247))

> Jameson wonders whether we might in fact be missing a trick about this transcontinental marvel of planning and logistics: The literary utopists have scarcely kept pace with the businessmen in the process of imagination and construction … ignoring a global infrastructural deployment in which, from this quite different perspective, the Walmart celebrated by Friedman becomes the very anticipatory prototype of some new form of socialism for which the reproach of centralization now proves historically misplaced and irrelevant. It is in any case certainly a revolutionary reorganization of capitalist production, and some acknowledgment such as “Waltonism” or “Walmartification” would be a more appropriate name for this new stage.

> Since the neoliberal revolution of the 1970s and its acceleration following the end of the Cold War, economic planning at scale has been widely derided from right to center-left, and planned endeavors such as public healthcare have been under attack from marketization in most countries. In most jurisdictions, the electricity systems that were once in public hands have long since been privatized; therefore governments committed to efforts to decarbonize electricity companies have had little choice but to employ market mechanisms such as emissions trading or carbon taxation, rather than reducing greenhouse gas emissions via democratic fiat—that is, simply ordering the electricity provider to switch to non-emitting fuel sources.

> Therefore, any economy the size of an entire country that tried to replace the myriad decisions from the multitude of sovereign consumers with the plans of bureaucrats working from incorrigibly flawed data would regularly produce vast, chasm-like mismatches between what is demanded and what is supplied.

argument from von Mises vs Neurath

---

> Mises’s argument in his 1920 essay, later developed through a series of books, is described to this day by his acolytes as his masterpiece. And not without reason: it is perhaps the strongest argument ever mounted against the idea of socialism. How, indeed, could we replace prices with planning boards? And isn’t socialism supposed to be direct rule by the workers, rather than a replacement of unelected bosses with remote bureaucrats? If centralized by bureaucrats, how could all that information be gathered? And if decentralized, how could all those millions (and globally, billions) of workers democratically coordinate production decisions? ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=378))

---

> Neurath, for his part, insisted that prices in the market, as descriptors for behavior in an economy, are no less corrupted by this loss of fidelity because they fail to capture sufficient information on the material circumstances of citizens and fail to describe adequately all the costs or benefits of actions. In a system with market-based provision of healthcare, for instance, price does not describe information on inability to access healthcare, just as price does not reflect the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the average temperature of the planet.

> It would be far too expensive in terms of labor costs for one tiny store to be able to maintain a commercial relationship with thousands of record labels, and vice versa; but that store can have a relationship with, say, five distributors, each of whom have a relationship with, say, a hundred labels. The use of distributors also minimizes inventory costs while maximizing the variety that a store can offer, at the same time offering everyone along the supply chain a more accurate knowledge of demand. So while your local shop may not carry albums from Hello Kitty Pencil Case Records, via the banal magic of distributors, your tiny local shop will have a relationship with more record labels than they otherwise could.

> “Continuous replenishment” is a bit of a misnomer, as the system actually provides merely very frequent restocking (from the supplier to the distributor and thence the retailer), in which the decision on the amount and the timing of replenishment lies with the supplier, not the retailer.

> “Organizations need a holistic strategy,” according to the former head of the DieHard battery unit, Erik Rosenstrauch. Indeed they do. But is not society as a whole an organization?

To take just one example: the continued combustion of coal, oil and gas may be a disaster for our species as a whole, but so long as it remains profitable for some of Eddie’s “divisions,” those responsible for extracting and processing fossil fuels, these will continue to act in a way that serves their particular interests, the rest of the company—or in this case the rest of society—be damned.

---

> Open nearly any introductory economics textbook, however, and the world appears as a nearly boundless realm of choice. Among the paeans to freedom and to the spontaneous efficiency of markets, few words even graze the everyday planning that goes on within the four walls of the firm. Fewer, still, name it as coercive. Planning under capitalism is about making people do things—without their input and not necessarily in their interest. At best, economists will bring up planning in order to ridicule it, failing, or refusing, to grasp its centrality even in a market system.

> However, Smith himself understood that real economies involve all manner of nonmarket interactions—even the phrase “invisible hand” makes but a single appearance in his Wealth of Nations.

> market socialism. The two thinkers complemented each other so well that the idea that socialist planning could replicate capitalist efficiency came to be called the Lange-Lerner theorem.

> Such defeatism alarmed another Austrian economist, Friedrich von Hayek, who, following in the footsteps of Mises, was determined to prove Lange wrong. Hayek is better known today as the godfather of neoliberalism, the pro-market ideology that has come to dominate government policy around much of the world, the first incarnation of which is best exemplified by the administrations of Margaret Thatcher in the UK and Ronald Reagan in the United States during the 1980s. Hayek was explicit about wanting ideological regime change. The postwar welfare state truce between capital and labor had barely been installed when Hayek joined a small group of right-wing radicals to found the Mont Pelerin Society in 1944—a free market think tank before its time. It was integral to their task of reshaping ideology that they have at the ready a rebuke to Lange, Lerner and the other socialists who looked to have the upper hand.

> Buying and selling may not generate technical and scientific knowledge, but it still creates all that knowledge of “time and place” that is instrumental to making efficient production and distribution decisions. Hayek argued that the problem for planners was not in the “how”—the equations to use—but in the “what”—the data that goes into the equations. The copious information planners need is unavailable before markets work their magic. Decentralization creates coordination: only the market can bring together the information that is normally isolated in the heads of different individuals.

> What he is after is not so much freedom for people, but rather freedom for information and money—those two central lubricants of market activity.

Uber uses a five-star driver rating system in which drivers must maintain an average rating of 4.6 stars to keep driving for the company. Uber can “suggest” certain norms for its drivers to follow (how much to smile, what kind of extra services to offer, and so on), but in reality it is the risk of even one bad rating that quickly prods them to fall into line. Yet there is no top-down rule; when businesses can constantly collect and analyze information, strict management happens from the bottom up. Uber’s business model is to use the economics of information to do more than just sell ad space. The company’s ability to make people do things without telling them explicitly is not unique and is but a refinement of capitalism’s ability to make people complicit in their own unfreedom—a refinement made possible by a greater amount of and greater control over information.

Excellent point about control of information enforcing despotic rule from the bottom up

> On the other hand, rather than the herald of dystopian workplaces everywhere, Uber is also a natural candidate for a worker co-op. All that Uber provides, after all, is an app; the company is nothing but a middleman. A cooperatively owned network of drivers using a similar app could set pay rates and work rules democratically, in the here and now. A drivers’ co-op would be far superior to the venture capital–fueled behemoth we have today, even if this is a form of enterprise that, while introducing more workplace democracy than is normally possible under capitalism in the short run, is still subject to the same profit-seeking imperatives as any firm within capitalism—imperatives that will prompt self-exploitation in order to compete with other enterprises, thus ultimately undermining these very same democratic impulses.

Nice idea here for uber as worker co-op - and yes app/engineeeing plays a role there

> Similarly, social networks could be run as public utilities rather than as private monopolies—remember that we created public electricity or water works after the failures of nineteenth-century robber baron capitalism. One of the big questions of the twenty-first century will be, who owns and controls the data that is quickly becoming a key economic resource? Will it be the fuel for democratic planning, or instead for a new more authoritarian capitalism? ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=866))

> Fossil fuels are a contemporary example of this irremediable, critical flaw. Wonderful though they have been due to their energy density and portability—freeing us energetically from the caprices of Mother Nature, who may or may not blow windmills or turn waterwheels when we want her to—we now know that the greenhouse gases emitted by fossil fuel combustion will rapidly shift the planet away from an average temperature that has remained optimal for human flourishing since the last ice age.

> Conversely, if something is useful but unprofitable, it will not be produced. In the United States, for instance, where there is no universal public healthcare system, healthcare for all would be wonderfully useful. But because it is not profitable, it is not produced. High-speed internet in rural areas is not profitable, so private telecommunications companies are loathe to provide it there, preferring instead to cherry-pick profitable population-dense neighborhoods.

> As a 2008 “call to arms” paper from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) put it, “[Antibiotics] are less desirable to drug companies and venture capitalists because they are more successful than other drugs.” Antibiotics are successful if they kill off an infection, at which point—days or weeks, or at most months, later—the patient stops taking the drug. For chronic diseases, however, patients may have to take their medicine every day, sometimes for the rest of their lives. Thus, the paper concluded, it is long-term therapy—not cures—that drives interest in drug development. ([Location 120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=120))

> Beyond this one sector, we might note that basic research in any field—that blue-sky stuff, where scientists are led by simple curiosity and have no expectation of developing any marketable product, and which is the basis of technologies and medicines that later turn out to be very marketable indeed—simply cannot be done by the private sector. This type of research is extremely expensive but makes no guarantee of any return on such spending. Such research thus is almost entirely a phenomenon characteristic of public institutions or private charities rather than market actors. Similarly, it was not the market that got us to the moon, but a grand public-sector enterprise called NASA. ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=128))

> Past generations have fought to expand the realm of freedom—to ensure all adult humans have the same rights and to ensure that any new capabilities delivered through technological advance are to be made available to all. And if we are to continue this battle to correct the titanic, manifest unfairness of the way things are, we must therefore wage a struggle over which method for the allocation of things we want as a society. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=145))

---

> Nevertheless, the free(-ish) market is a necessary condition for capitalism—one that, as a method of allocation, leads to growing inequality via disparities in the distribution of income. Market interactions inevitably produce winners and losers, leading to concentrations of wealth. Over time, these disparities grow, a product of these same market interactions.

> Real markets are a far cry from this idealized fairy tale: companies regularly collude to keep out competitors, large corporations constantly lobby for government subsidies, and it is the norm that a few big players dominate entire product categories and set prices. One market in particular—the labor market—needed centuries of coercion and dispossession to turn peasants and farmers into workers willing to sell their labor for a wage. Frequently, supply and demand do not reach equilibrium; as a result, the market system regularly leads to crises of overproduction, which in turn provoke recessions and depressions, with wrenching consequences for millions of people.

> Even arch-capitalist America is home not only to Walmart and Amazon, but also to the Pentagon: in spite of being incredibly destructive, the US Department of Defense is the single-largest employer in the world, and a centrally planned public sector operation. In fact, almost all countries are mixed economies that include various combinations of markets and planning. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=176))

---

> In an oft-repeated passage from The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith wrote that “the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another” led to the division of labor, the invention of money and greater economic complexity. This bit of make-believe has been passed down for centuries and can still be found in most introductory economics textbooks. The problem with this intriguing tale is that it is false. Specialization developed within large household compounds where there was no internal exchange; heads of households distributed total household production among members—they planned. Money, on the other hand, arose largely as a tool for traders, mercenaries and others to settle debts with the ancient temples. As economic complexity grew, money was more widely adopted as a means of keeping track of taxes and other major transactions.

> This is not to say there was some Arcadia of central planning at this time, any more than it is accurate to describe hunter-gatherer society as some peaceful egalitarian Eden. The planning of the ancients was not only rudimentary and partial; it was also far from being a rational way of securing the shared benefit of all. Indeed, ancient planning was at the service of an economic system created for the benefit of a small coterie of elites who were motivated to maintain their wealth and power. Sound familiar?

> There is not only a crying need for us to talk about what that alternative to the market would be, but also a great deal of confusion about what planning is and its history. To take one example: China appears to be the last man standing in the global economy; its growth rates, even if they have declined recently from eye popping to merely gobsmacking, have been achieved through an admixture of free market mechanisms and very heavy shepherding by authoritarian central planners. It seems even some members of the ascendant bourgeoisie in that country believe that Mao’s economic planning was less mistaken than premature. A 2018 Financial Times feature describes Jack Ma, founder of the Chinese e-commerce colossus Alibaba Group, as part of a growing movement in the People’s Republic who argue that “the fatal flaw of state planning was simply that planners did not have enough information to make good decisions.” ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=212))

---

> Above all, our goal with this brief text is simply to flag a rarely recognized, yet obvious, fact that in some sense makes the “calculation debate” anachronistic: it is already the case that great swaths of the global economy exist outside the market and are planned.

> Since the demise of post-war technological optimism in the ’70s, Jameson finds that the once robust tradition of utopian thinking has waned considerably; the bare handful of fresh utopias that he identifies as having emerged—be it cyberpunk aesthetics or the cheerleading for corporate-led globalization—appear wholly unimaginative in comparison to their promethean and modernist predecessors, who did not content themselves to merely transform realms of communication and information the way contemporary utopians might. These are mere sectoral concerns, he says, rather than grander, society-wide ambitions; they are not comprehensive utopias.

It is in any case certainly a revolutionary reorganization of capitalist production, and some acknowledgment such as “Waltonism” or “Walmartification” would be a more appropriate name for this new stage.

> Since the neoliberal revolution of the 1970s and its acceleration following the end of the Cold War, economic planning at scale has been widely derided from right to center-left, and planned endeavors such as public healthcare have been under attack from marketization in most countries. In most jurisdictions, the electricity systems that were once in public hands have long since been privatized; therefore governments committed to efforts to decarbonize electricity companies have had little choice but to employ market mechanisms such as emissions trading or carbon taxation, rather than reducing greenhouse gas emissions via democratic fiat—that is, simply ordering the electricity provider to switch to non-emitting fuel sources.

> Therefore, any economy the size of an entire country that tried to replace the myriad decisions from the multitude of sovereign consumers with the plans of bureaucrats working from incorrigibly flawed data would regularly produce vast, chasm-like mismatches between what is demanded and what is supplied.

argument from von Mises vs Neurath

---

> Mises’s argument in his 1920 essay, later developed through a series of books, is described to this day by his acolytes as his masterpiece. And not without reason: it is perhaps the strongest argument ever mounted against the idea of socialism. How, indeed, could we replace prices with planning boards? And isn’t socialism supposed to be direct rule by the workers, rather than a replacement of unelected bosses with remote bureaucrats? If centralized by bureaucrats, how could all that information be gathered? And if decentralized, how could all those millions (and globally, billions) of workers democratically coordinate production decisions? ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=378))

---

> Neurath, for his part, insisted that prices in the market, as descriptors for behavior in an economy, are no less corrupted by this loss of fidelity because they fail to capture sufficient information on the material circumstances of citizens and fail to describe adequately all the costs or benefits of actions. In a system with market-based provision of healthcare, for instance, price does not describe information on inability to access healthcare, just as price does not reflect the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the average temperature of the planet.

> It would be far too expensive in terms of labor costs for one tiny store to be able to maintain a commercial relationship with thousands of record labels, and vice versa; but that store can have a relationship with, say, five distributors, each of whom have a relationship with, say, a hundred labels. The use of distributors also minimizes inventory costs while maximizing the variety that a store can offer, at the same time offering everyone along the supply chain a more accurate knowledge of demand.

Among the paeans to freedom and to the spontaneous efficiency of markets, few words even graze the everyday planning that goes on within the four walls of the firm. Fewer, still, name it as coercive. Planning under capitalism is about making people do things—without their input and not necessarily in their interest.

Hayek was explicit about wanting ideological regime change. The postwar welfare state truce between capital and labor had barely been installed when Hayek joined a small group of right-wing radicals to found the Mont Pelerin Society in 1944—a free market think tank before its time. It was integral to their task of reshaping ideology that they have at the ready a rebuke to Lange, Lerner and the other socialists who looked to have the upper hand.

Shirking is not an innate tendency toward laziness, but rather the way people are under capitalism. ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=811))

> Rather than being overrun by unthinking self-interest, shared resources were in reality often governed by complex sets of social rules established over time. Ostrom studied actual shared pasture land in Swiss alpine villages and found it had been preserved for common use for over 500 years. Based on this and other case studies, Ostrom went on to identify conditions that helped protect common resources—among them, participation in decision making by users of the resources, the capacity for monitoring usage, meaningful social sanctions and conflict-resolution mechanisms.

> Uber’s drivers, on the other hand, are poorly-paid “contractors.” No longer classified as workers (except in the UK where courts reinstated their rights as workers), they can make below minimum wage and have few labor rights. As with more and more workers in a range of sectors, they are under constant, nigh on panoptical, surveillance via data. Uber uses a five-star driver rating system in which drivers must maintain an average rating of 4.6 stars to keep driving for the company. Uber can “suggest” certain norms for its drivers to follow (how much to smile, what kind of extra services to offer, and so on), but in reality it is the risk of even one bad rating that quickly prods them to fall into line. Yet there is no top-down rule; when businesses can constantly collect and analyze information, strict management happens from the bottom up. Uber’s business model is to use the economics of information to do more than just sell ad space. The company’s ability to make people do things without telling them explicitly is not unique and is but a refinement of capitalism’s ability to make people complicit in their own unfreedom—a refinement made possible by a greater amount of and greater control over information.

Excellent point about control of information enforcing despotic rule from the bottom up

> On the other hand, rather than the herald of dystopian workplaces everywhere, Uber is also a natural candidate for a worker co-op. All that Uber provides, after all, is an app; the company is nothing but a middleman. A cooperatively owned network of drivers using a similar app could set pay rates and work rules democratically, in the here and now. A drivers’ co-op would be far superior to the venture capital–fueled behemoth we have today, even if this is a form of enterprise that, while introducing more workplace democracy than is normally possible under capitalism in the short run, is still subject to the same profit-seeking imperatives as any firm within capitalism—imperatives that will prompt self-exploitation in order to compete with other enterprises, thus ultimately undermining these very same democratic impulses.

Nice idea here for uber as worker co-op - and yes app/engineeeing plays a role there

> Similarly, social networks could be run as public utilities rather than as private monopolies—remember that we created public electricity or water works after the failures of nineteenth-century robber baron capitalism. One of the big questions of the twenty-first century will be, who owns and controls the data that is quickly becoming a key economic resource? Will it be the fuel for democratic planning, or instead for a new more authoritarian capitalism? ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=866))

> Planning is not only possible, but is already all around us, albeit in hierarchical and undemocratic forms. What a very different, democratic planning will look like is a question a new generation of progressive economists needs to begin today to discuss, debate and test through modeling. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075HY7DWZ&location=907))

this type of collective planning is reminiscent of Hagglund's arguments. I worry that centralized "planners" enforces a technocratic elite...
