The inspiration for Japhy Ryder in Dharma Bums (one of most influential for me)
In the 1950s, Snyder took part in the rise of a strand of Buddhist anarchism emerging from the [Beat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_generation "Beat generation") movement. Snyder was the inspiration for the Japhy Ryder character in Kerouac's novel _[The Dharma Bums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dharma_Bums "The Dharma Bums")_ (1958). Snyder had spent considerable time in Japan studying Zen Buddhism, and in 1961 published an essay, "Buddhist Anarchism", where he described the connection he saw between these two traditions, originating in different parts of the world: "The [mercy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercy "Mercy") of the [West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture "Western culture") has been [social revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_revolution "Social revolution"); the mercy of the [East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East "East") has been individual insight into the basic self/void." He advocated "using such means as [civil disobedience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience "Civil disobedience"), outspoken criticism, protest, [pacifism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifism "Pacifism"), voluntary poverty and even gentle violence" and defended "the right of individuals to smoke [ganja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)), eat [peyote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyote "Peyote"), be [polygynous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygyny "Polygyny"), [polyandrous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyandrous "Polyandrous") or homosexual" which he saw as being banned by "the Judaeo-Capitalist-Christian-Marxist West".[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Snyder#cite_note-35)
