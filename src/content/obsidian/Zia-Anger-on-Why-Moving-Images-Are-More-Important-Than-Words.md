## Highlights
- I think it’s because of access to everything. With the internet, you can see everything. That’s why I think moving images are so important. For me, it wasn’t that important growing up. It was this escapist thing. Now it’s like the written word. Not knowing how to write at this point is not a big deal, but not knowing how to use your phone and how to make videos is a big deal. To be able to understand moving images is a big deal. More so than writing.
- Young people are communicating with each other that way. That’s the thing: they’re communicating! To understand the nuances of what putting two shots next to each other means is important. To understand that there are these rules that are broken when it comes to montage. To be able, as a young person, to understand how people use moving images to manipulate things. To be able to look at something and be like, “I know what they’re trying to say to me.” Like, “They’re not being honest about it. They’re actually saying something really bad,” or, “They’re saying something really good. How do I tell everybody what I’m thinking?”
  It’s this basic thing that, to me, is like the written word. If you don’t know how to do it, it’s a kind of illiteracy. Which is not fair. It’s beyond not fair. It’s like End Times. It’s how people are going to survive or not survive.
- I’m not talking about it that way. I’m just saying there are so many different types of moving images and places that we see these things. It’s post-language. There are many different ways of doing it and techniques and all that shit, but ultimately, there is an alphabet.
  It’s an alphabet that I hate. Most of my work is denying the alphabet, denying the tradition of it. But at least I learned the tradition. I can look at the stupid commercial on the phone, the Red Lobster one that literally always comes on whenever I watch something on YouTube, and I understand what it’s trying to tell me. There’s a power in that.
- All the stuff that I’ve done that is small has been self-financed. You can keep going in that way and making bigger and bigger and bigger: self-funded in a way where you are pulling from the people around you who are a part of you or a part of your family or whatever. Then, there’s this unicorn thing every filmmaker I know, who is doing well, has gotten. They’re like, “Yeah, this really rich person gave me money.” You have to find the rich person.
- Zia Anger Recommends:
  Southland Tales (film)
  a hairbrush to stimulate scalp (keep the blood flowing!)
  macrobiotic cooking
  The Argonauts by Maggie Nelson
  “I Love Kanye” by Kanye West
  Brecht’s Lehrstücke
- You could just make it with your cell phone if you had to. For me, I’m always like, “How would you do something like that but, without all of that other stuff?” How can you express those ideas without all that other stuff? All that other stuff but the budget version, where you go to the store and you get a face mask for 99 cents and you put that on. Can that be just as powerful as a $5,000 mask that somebody was supposed to wear? I don’t know. The financing thing is really difficult because I’m trying to do things for no money but then, you kind of want a lot of money.
- Everyone sits here and they’re nostalgic for film and the cameras and all that type of stuff and blah, blah, blah. I’m like, “No.” It’s not like cameras ever went away. Actually, more and more people have access to cameras and making films in their own phone. It’s problematic because you have put it on Instagram and that’s owned by Facebook and Facebook owns all of your fucking material but, it is still exercising the equivalent of the written word
- Right now, in this whole paradigm shift, moving images are the great equalizer.
- It’s absolutely insane that that’s how little people are learning that they can make their own things. Even if there’s no money for art at school, their parents or a friend of the family is carrying around a phone with a video camera on it. But a kid goes walking down the street and they see a film shoot and ask: “What is that?” Someone’s like, “That’s a movie. You couldn’t make that.” They get this idea that they couldn’t make it. It’s insane because they can!
- I think the difference between the written word and film, is that there’s this illusion that you need a lot of money with film. You need a lot of equipment. It’s not true. I want to make filmmaking something that’s easy and a part of everyday life.
