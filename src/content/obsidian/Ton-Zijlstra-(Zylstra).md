Great old-school blog on internet, thinking, etc.

Been very active in the [[Obsidian]] community.

Here's his crazy [[PKM]] system, outlined in [[Tinderbox]] (green boxes are in Obsidian) ^609108

2021-12-16 I actually really like this model because it (whether intentionally or not) is a good model for [[BASB]] - 12 Favorite Problems/Goals, Project List, Areas, Resources, etc all feeding into each other

Collecting from old blogs:

> My own workflow is: I have a blog widget that shows me my old blogposts 'on this day in previous years'. If they're of interest I clip them to markdown into a folder. I have a dataview that shows me those clipped own blogposts as a list, and I pick and choose from it based on energy and whim, and lift stuff for notes from it. Similarly if a blogpost mentions or embeds a presentation I put it on a list to peruse. Some presentations I made are quite dense, where each slides turns into its own note.

Using clippings folder:

> -   I have an inbox folder in my vault that I named ‘NewClippings’, and use the MarkDownload web clipper (browser add-on) to clip webpages directly to it with a sentence or two about why I store it and immediate associations with existing material.
>     
>     Self written notes I do directly in Obsidian, either on laptop mobile or e-ink reader.  
>     From NewClippings I daily take one or more for close reading and taking out the info I want to keep.

> I use the markdown webclipper to clip articles to a folder NewClippings in my Obsidian vault. The markdown clipper allows you to define a template with front and after sections. At the top when clipping I add my motivation for saving it, what caught my eye, where I think it might connect to. When I later search for something I will also find clipped articles that might be relevant to it. I may then take one of them read them in earnest, starting from my original motivation, and take something from it to keep in my own notes. If not, that’s fine, then it’s just a list of potential resources. But adding the context for saving them is key to me, otherwise it’s just a random collection of articles, where each time I encounter them I would need to re-evaluate why it might be in my collection of clippings.


> 
> The workflow I use is that I start mostly from my feed reader, scanning for interesting bits (in comparison to my current list of interests), and using the surprise I feel as antenna. Sometimes I save the posting that’s in my reader itself, but more often I save the article / paper the posting links to / discusses. When saving I add my rationale for doing so. I started using that markdown clipper to an Obsidian folder last year November and now have just under 700 articles clipped (plus a much lower number of scientific articles / pdfs saved to Zotero).
> 
> I don’t use Instapaper et al anymore (years ago I used to be a paying customer). Mostly because I found I wasn’t using it usefully.
> I should be doing triage, meaning scanning the content of an article or reading it quickly once, briefly thinking about its meaning to me, and deciding to save it or not, and when saving adding my reasons to it so future-me has some info to go on. My current set-up does that. With Instapaper I found that I did not actually triage, I did headline scanning and then saved it. But usually never bothered to go back. I was not triaging, I was postponing triage. So it fell into the collectors fallacy.

Using Boox and book notes:

> Hi I have a Boox Nova 2. As it’s an Android device I loaded the Google app store, and installed Obsidian on it through the app store. I use Obsidian sync to sync between the Boox and my Mac.
> What I currently do is transfer my book comments/highlights to Zotero, and handwritten notes on the Boox to Obsidian, by connecting my Boox to the Mac over USB, and transfer the files with Android File Transfer.
> What I intend to do is have the notes on the Boox be stored in a folder that is part of the Obsidian vault, so they will sync over Obsidian sync. Haven’t checked yet if that works.
> My Boox storage my limit the utility of that however, in that it would fill up the device too quickly if I don’t remove handwritten notes from time to time.

Using local graph for note-writing:
> I find the local graphs showing links 2 (or 3 if there are few) steps out the most useful, while writing in a note. It shows me the entire 'neighborhood' of a note, and can lead to new connections/associations. The main graph I sometimes look at if there are 'important' notes standing out that may not be on my radar yet as a growing node of importance.

> I make two different types of MoC/outlines.
> 
> One type is what I call an 'emergent outline' (Ahrens talks about speculative outlines in the same sense I think). These are output oriented, but not triggered by a pre-existing plan to make a specific output (which gets more towards outlining, which I do as well). I create one where I see myself making notes around something and feel there's something to tell. I gather links to notes in it, re-arrange, etc.
> 
> The second one is more akin to what Milo calls Maps of Content (I dislike the the term), I've dubbed them 'elephant paths'. These are more like navigational devices for me, to quickly move about in sections of my conceptual notes (networked in nature), and connect those to my practical notes (work related, more hierarchical in nature). They're also emergent, not pre-determined or created up front: when I find myself repeatedly looking for/at some notes an elephant path might be useful. They do over time build up to a sort of hierarchy I expect, in the sense that, like with Milo's MOCs over time layers emerge.
> 
> (To give a sense of size: I have some 5k5 notes, of which 1k2 are conceptual, and about 4k more operational)
