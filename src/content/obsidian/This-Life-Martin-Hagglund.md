On Martin Hägglund's _This Life_.

We begin the 2023 Reading Club with the theme of FREEDOM. In this episode, we examine Martin Hägglund's arguments for _secular faith_ presented in the first half of his book. Is Hagglund right in arguing that much of religious belief, especially in relation to morality, is actually motivated by secular faith?  
  
Hägglund's enemy is not so much religion as the "Stoic" attempt to withdraw and detach from the temporal world. Instead we should be engaged and committed to the persons and projects we care about in this life. But does Hägglund underestimate alienation? Is his approach overly demanding?  
  
And what about disenchantment? How would we go about re-enchanting the secular world?

On Martin Hägglund's _This Life_.

We continue on the theme of freedom. In this episode, we look at what Martin Hägglund describes as 'spiritual freedom', which can ultimately be seen as a question of what we do with our time. Across the two chapters in question, Hägglund ties together his philosophical vision rooted in the notion of mortality and temporal life, with a social critique that draws on Hegel and Marx. He does this by centring the question of _time,_ the only truly scarce resource.

How can we negotiate anxiety-inducing freedom today? Where do our 'existential identities' come from, and does Hägglund put too much emphasis on identity? And is Buddhist karma a system analogous to the market?

/336/ Reading Club: Freedom (3)

On Martin Hägglund's _This Life_.

We continue on the theme of freedom by discussing Martin Hägglund's case for 'democratic socialism'. Would we actually work under socialism, or do we need the threat of starvation or the promise of profit to motivate us? And what, if anything, is to structure all that free time we would gain?

Why is Hägglund's critique of religion – specifically the critique of 'political theology' – so central to his arguments? And how do we avoid the various temptations to retreat from passion, be it therapy-junk, new age buddhism, the goon cave, or post-politics?

## Highlights
- My family comes from northern Sweden. The house where my mother was born, and where I have spent every summer of my life, is on the Baltic Sea. ([Location 59](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=59))
    - mw:: gotta say this intro immediately reminds me of knausgaard's hate of sweden lol
- To be finite means primarily two things: to be dependent on others and to live in relation to death. I am finite because I cannot maintain my life on my own and because I will die. Likewise, the projects to which I am devoted are finite because they live only through the efforts of those who are committed to them and will cease to be if they are abandoned. ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=75))
- An eternal activity—just as much as an eternal rest—is of concern to no one, since it cannot be stopped and does not have to be maintained by anyone. The problem is not that an eternal activity would be “boring” but that it would not be intelligible as my activity. Any activity of mine (including a boring activity) requires that I sustain it. In an eternal activity, there cannot be a person who is bored—or involved in any other way—since an eternal activity does not depend on being sustained by anyone. ([Location 84](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=84))
    - mw:: Strikes me as a naive and maateriallisticc nswer.
- The sense of finitude—the sense of the ultimate fragility of everything we care about—is at the heart of what I call secular faith. To have secular faith is to be devoted to a life that will end, to be dedicated ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=99))
    - mw:: Lol like youre the first person to ever call it that. Come on man
- All world religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity) hold that the highest form of existence or the most desirable form of life is eternal rather than finite. To be religious—or to adopt a religious perspective on life—is to regard our finitude as a lack, an illusion, or a fallen state of being. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=108))
    - mw:: .... I guess, kind of, but feels also obtuse. Even tho i ultinatelltlt agreee with haaaglund. Buddhisst recoofbittion off emmptiineess is not about eternnal.
- To have secular faith is to acknowledge that the object of our faith is dependent on the practice of faith. I call it secular faith, since the object of devotion does not exist independently of those who believe in its importance and who keep it alive through their fidelity. The object of secular faith—e.g., the life we are trying to lead, the institutions we are trying to build, the community we are trying to achieve—is inseparable from what we do and how we do it. Through the practice of secular faith, we bind ourselves to a normative ideal (a conception of who we ought to be as individuals and as a community). The ideal itself, however, depends on how we keep faith with our commitment and remains open to being challenged, transformed, or overturned. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=123))
    - mw:: Ok yes
- The object of religious faith—whether God or any other form of infinite being—is ultimately regarded as separable from the practice of faith, since it does not depend on any form of finite life. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=129))
    - mw:: This is just plainly wrong. Christianity depends on essential faith of story of Jesus. If its wrong abandon all ye faith.
- As William James observes in the conclusion to his classic work The Varieties of Religious Experience, the subordination of the finite to the eternal is the common denominator both for orthodox religions and for all forms of religious mysticism. “This world may indeed, as science assures us, some day burn up or freeze,” James writes, but for those with religious faith “God’s existence is the guarantee of an ideal order that shall be permanently preserved.”2 Accordingly, from a religious point of view, the end of the world is ultimately not a tragedy. ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=134))
    - mw:: Yes, this is the primary point
- For the same reason, climate change and the possible destruction of the Earth cannot be seen as an existential threat from the standpoint of religious faith. To grasp the existential threat to yourself and to future generations, you have to believe not only that life is finite but also that everything valuable—everything that matters—depends on finite life. This is exactly what religious faith denies. ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=143))
    - mw:: Hm. Will stop noting now
- If you are aiming for eternal life, finite life does not matter for its own sake but serves as a vehicle to attain salvation. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=155))
- My point, however, is that if you care for our form of life as an end in itself, you are acting on the basis of secular faith, even if you claim to be religious. Religious faith can entail obedience to moral norms, but it cannot recognize that the ultimate purpose of what we do—the ultimate reason it matters how we treat one another and the Earth—is our fragile life together. ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=157))
    - mw:: Ok, yes, thabk you
- The ability to ask this question—the question of what we ought to do with our time—is the basic condition for what I call spiritual freedom. To lead a free, spiritual life (rather than a life determined merely by natural instincts), I must be responsible for what I do. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=206))
- In caring about anyone or anything, we are already practicing an implicit form of secular faith in what we do, since we are devoted to someone or something that is fragile. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=233))
- The second thesis postulates a religious plenitude: to compensate for its normative deficit, secular life must turn to religion as the unique and privileged resource of moral-political instruction without which society cannot cohere. As Gordon shows, these two theses of political theology are remarkably persistent not only in the history of ideas but also in contemporary philosophy and sociology.5 ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=241))
    - mw:: Gramsci argues that a failure of the left is inability to take place of religion in some sense
- The most influential version of such a negative assessment of secular life was formulated by the sociologist Max Weber in the early twentieth century. Weber’s famous claim that secular life suffers from a “disenchantment” of the world continues to serve as an alibi for political theology and to instill the sense that a society without religious faith is hopelessly lacking. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=249))
    - mw:: Cc Burbea enchanting the cosmos
- First, disenchantment means that we no longer appeal to any “mysterious incalculable forces”—or any other forms of supernatural explanation—for what happens in the world. Rather, the form of reason becomes an instrumental reason, which assumes that “we can, in principle, control everything by means of calculation.” Second, Weber takes disenchantment to mean that “the ultimate and most sublime values have retreated from public life,” so that we are deprived of any form of “genuine community.” Third, Weber laments that disenchantment entails that death is no longer “a meaningful phenomenon.” ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=253))
    - mw:: All very valid
- Opinion on the genuineness of community would depend on whose experience was consulted. If you asked landless laborers in the Middle Ages, such community might have seemed less unquestionably genuine.”10 Furthermore, ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=326))
    - mw:: Counter pastoral nostalgia
- The dissatisfactions of our current state of secularization are not due to the idea of progress. As Robbins emphasizes, the dissatisfactions are rather due to “the failure of progress,” namely, our “failure to achieve a level of social justice that the premodern world did not even strive to achieve.” ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=332))
- Marx’s thinking is often conflated with the totalitarian communist regimes of the twentieth century, but I will argue that he is the most important inheritor of the secular commitment to freedom and democracy. In contrast to Weber and other political theologians, Marx has no nostalgia for the premodern world. Rather, he makes clear that both capitalism and liberalism are historical conditions of possibility for the emancipation that he espouses. This is why Marx, in his critique of capitalism and liberalism, takes issue with these forms of life on their own terms. He seeks to show that capitalism and liberalism require their own overcoming by virtue of the secular commitment they bear within themselves to freedom and democracy. ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=336))
- The workers’ movements organized youth groups, choirs, book clubs, sports teams, and other communal activities. They pursued democracy on the ground by publishing daily newspapers and journals that provided a forum for ongoing, open debate about the stakes and goals of the movement. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=346))
    - mw:: Denning disxusses this as well
- The words of a German miner, aged thirty-three and with eight children, echo the testimony of many workers from this period. “The modern labor movement,” he said in 1912, “enriches me and all my friends through the growing light of recognition. We understand that we are no longer the anvil but rather the hammer that forms the future of our children, and that feeling is worth more than gold.”13 This sense of spiritual freedom—that we can be the subjects of our history and not merely subject to our history—is at the core of Marx’s notion of emancipation. ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=349))
- The task is all the more important because the appeal to freedom in recent decades has been appropriated for agendas on the political right, where the idea of freedom serves to defend “the free market” and is largely reduced to a formal conception of individual liberty. In response, many thinkers on the political left have retreated from or even explicitly rejected the idea of freedom. This is a fatal mistake. Any emancipatory politics—as well as any critique of capitalism—requires a conception of freedom. Only in light of a commitment to freedom can we render anything intelligible as oppression, exploitation, or alienation. Moreover, only in light of a commitment to freedom can we give an account of what we are trying to achieve and why it matters. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=369))
- The economic organization of our society is not a mere instrumental means for the pursuit of individual ends. Rather, our shared economy is itself expressive of how we understand the relation between means and ends. Economic matters are not abstract but concern the most general and concrete questions of what we do with our time. As I will show in detail, how we organize our economy is intrinsic to how we live together and what we collectively value. ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=376))
- Marx’s analyses of economic questions proceed from a philosophical grasp of what it means to be living and free. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=380))
- A living being cannot simply exist but must do something to stay alive. The need of the living organism to sustain itself—the labor required to keep ourselves alive—minimally defines what Marx calls the realm of necessity. Because we are living beings, we must work to maintain ourselves. Yet, all the time we have is not necessarily required to ensure our biological survival and it is an open question for us what we should do with the surplus of time. This is why, for Marx, we also live in the realm of freedom. We are able to engage our life activity as a free activity, since we can ask ourselves what to do and if it is the right thing to do. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=382))
- through technological innovations (from simple tools to advanced machines) we can reduce the time we need to expend on securing our survival, by replacing large parts of our living labor with nonliving capacities for producing social goods. We can thereby decrease our realm of necessity (the time required to keep ourselves alive) and increase our realm of freedom ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=387))
    - mw:: This hasnt happened tho
- To live a free life, it is not enough that we have the right to freedom. We must have access to the material resources as well as the forms of education that allow us to pursue our freedom and to “own” the question of what to do with our time. What belongs to each one of us—what is irreducibly our own—is not property or goods but the time of our lives. ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=395))
- As Marx underlines: “My own existence is social activity, and therefore that which I make of myself, I make of myself for society and with the awareness of myself as a social being.”17 Hence, to “own” your life is not to be independent but to be able to acknowledge your dependence. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=399))
- If you cannot see yourself in the purpose of your occupation, then your labor time is alienated, even if your job entails a high salary and great social prestige. This may seem like a small problem compared with the labor conditions of most of the people who produce the commodities that populate our world. There is certainly a harrowing difference between those who assemble our computers in factories or manufacture our clothes in sweatshops and those of us who turn on our computers or put on our clothes while forgetting the labor conditions under which they were produced. Yet from Marx’s perspective these issues are all connected, since they concern how our shared economic life is organized and how it is inimical to our freedom. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=409))
- The aim, then, is to decrease the realm of necessity and increase the realm of freedom by making the relation between the two a democratic question. We will always have to work—for better or for worse—but what will count as necessary labor and what will count as free labor is a matter of our commitments and our social organization. For the same reason, the relation between necessity and freedom cannot be settled once and for all but must always be negotiated. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=428))
- There are no definitive political solutions in Marx but rather the clarification of a vital problem. What we need to negotiate—both individually and collectively—is how to cultivate the finite time that is the condition of our freedom. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=431))
- The promise of achieving freedom through wage labor is necessarily contradicted, however, by how we measure the value of our lives under capitalism. Marx’s critique of the measure of value under capitalism is the most important argument in all of his work, but also the most misunderstood. Contrary to a widely held assumption—among both his followers on the Left and his critics on the Right—Marx does not subscribe to a general labor theory of value, which holds that labor is the necessary source of all wealth. Rather, Marx argues that the production of wealth under capitalism entails a historically specific measure of value (socially necessary labor time), which contradicts the value of free time and must be overcome for the sake of our emancipation. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=437))
- Drawing on what Marx calls communism, however, I outline a new vision of democratic socialism ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=447))
    - mw:: Oh noooooooooo
      Haaglund a) saying he invented dem soc and b) is it the watered down american version of it?
- This is why Marx emphasizes that the critique of religion must be accompanied by a critique of the existing forms of our life together. That those who are enslaved or live in poverty may need faith in God to carry on with their lives is not a reason to promote religious faith but a reason to abolish slavery and poverty. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=464))
- Thus, Augustine’s own account gives us reasons to keep faith in temporal life and overcome faith in eternity. To pursue this perspective would be to write a secular—rather than a religious—confession. I read such a secular confession in Karl Ove Knausgaard’s My Struggle, which can be seen as a contemporary response to Augustine. Knausgaard’s painstaking attention to a secular life places us in the midst of everyday existence. Like Augustine, he explores the care that binds us to others and how the experience of time cuts through every moment. But while Augustine seeks to turn us toward eternity, Knausgaard turns us back toward our finite lives as the heart of everything that matters. The animating principle of his writing is one of attachment to finite life, which is all the more profound because it remains faithful to the ambivalence of any attachment. Devoted to secular life, we can be moved both to bliss and devastation, hope and despair, success and failure. Knausgaard, then, makes vivid what it means to keep faith in a life that is bound to die. This secular faith, I argue, opens the possibility for all passion and meaningful engagement. ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=505))
    - mw:: Lfg
- If you believe that this value can be replaced—that Isaac will live on in eternity or be restored on earth—you will be indifferent to his fate in being put to death. Whether he lives or dies will ultimately make no difference to you, since everything that is lost will be returned. ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=535))
    - mw:: Cc this book with the kingdom ans a more sophisticated readinf of chrostiian theeloggy
- Yet, insofar as they cannot understand their time as free time—insofar as they cannot ask themselves what they ought to do with their time—even animals with highly refined capacities for self-enjoyment remain within the bounds of what I call “natural” freedom. In contrast, what I call spiritual freedom requires that the agent in question can ask herself how she should spend her time and be responsive to the risk that she is wasting her life. Without the relation to such a risk, we would not be able to lead a spiritual life, since we could never engage the question of what we ought to do with our time and what matters to us. ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=553))
- For Marx—contrary to a persistent misconception—the overcoming of capitalism is not meant to abolish democracy but to make actual democracy possible. Under capitalism, we cannot actually negotiate the fundamental questions of what we collectively value, since the purpose of our economy is beyond the power of democratic deliberation. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=575))
- From Hegel, I have learned the most profound lessons regarding what it means to lead a spiritual life and why our freedom is possible only through our mutual recognition of one another as essentially social, historical, material, and finite living beings. ([Location 607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=607))
    - mw:: Good disxusssion k hefwl
- What emerges through this account is not simply a crisis of faith, in the sense that the death of his wife makes him doubt the existence of God. What emerges is something deeper: an insight that his faith in God cannot offer any consolation for the loss of a loved one. If a mother is mourning the death of her child, Lewis writes, “she may still hope to ‘glorify God and enjoy him forever,’ ” which may be “a comfort to the God-aimed, eternal spirit within her. But not to her motherhood. The specifically maternal happiness must be written off. Never, in any place or time, will she have her son on her knees, or bathe him, or tell him a story, or plan for his future, or see her grandchild.”5 ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=636))
- This is why Lewis emphasizes that the Bible does not support visions of an afterlife that project reunions with the people you have loved throughout your life. Such visions are not directed toward God as the End, but at most treat God as a means for retrieving the mortal beloved. The vision of an afterlife where Lewis’s wife would welcome him is attached to living on with the beloved rather than to dwelling in the eternity of God. ([Location 671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=671))
- Lewis thus illuminates my central distinction between living on (prolonging a temporal life) and being eternal (absorbed in a timeless existence). As he makes agonizingly clear, the former cannot be reconciled with the latter. ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=674))
- The moments of profound intimacy would not be experienced as precious, but as the given state of things. You would expect everything to be settled, rather than dependent on your engagement and attention, as well as on the unforeseeable responses of your beloved. ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=693))
    - mw:: -
- Spinoza presents a clear version of what I call the religious aspiration to eternity. This aspiration is not limited to visions of a transcendent afterlife, but pertains just as well to an immanent ideal of attaining complete peace of mind. Indeed, I define as religious any ideal of being absolved from the pain of loss. While many religious ideals include pain and suffering as necessary steps on the way to salvation, the ultimate goal is to be absolved from vulnerability. ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=760))

- The most fundamental form of secular faith is the faith that life is worth living, which is intrinsic to all forms of care. In caring about our own lives and the lives of others, we necessarily believe that life is worth living. This is a matter of faith because we cannot prove that life is worth living despite all the suffering it entails. That life is worth living cannot be demonstrated through a logical deduction or rational calculation. Rather, the faith that life is worth living sustains us even when our lives seem to be unbearable or intolerable. Moreover, it is because we believe that life is worth living that our lives can appear as unbearable or intolerable in the first place. ([Location 794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=794))
- First, secular faith is an existential commitment. The faith that life is worth living is not caused by some vital force but is constituted by the commitment to a fragile form of life. The form of life to which we are committed is normative, since we lead our lives in light of a conception of who we ought to be and what we ought to do. Our existential commitment to a form of life is not reducible to a drive for self-preservation and is a condition for even the most altruistic deeds. ([Location 803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=803))
- Second, secular faith is a necessary uncertainty. In being committed to someone or something, I must have faith in the future and in those on whom I depend. I cannot be certain of what others will do, so I have to relate to them on the basis of faith. Faith provides the positive chance of having a relation to others—of trusting them—but it also opens the negative threat of being deceived or betrayed. The same holds for any relation to the future. ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=810))
- Third, the precariousness of secular faith is a motivational force. In keeping faith with a form of life—whether expressed through the commitment to a person, a project, or a principle—I have to believe that the object of faith is precarious. My commitment to the continued life of someone or something is inseparable from my sense that it cannot be taken for granted.

- One who has attained nirvana does not suffer from the loss of anything, since he or she is detached from everything that is finite. For this reason, the Buddhist notion of nirvana—whether conceived as an immanent tranquillity of being in the world or as a transcendent peace beyond life—is a clear and consistent version of the religious ideal of eternity. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=837))

- The latter attitude is what the philosopher Daniel Dennett has described as believing in belief in God. “Such a person doesn’t believe in God but nevertheless thinks that believing in God would be a wonderful state of mind to be in, if only that could be arranged.”16 This belief in the existential value of religious faith (rather than in the truth of religious claims) is the main line of defense for religion in a secular age, after its authority to organize society or legislate over science has been conceded. ([Location 876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=876))
- Even the greatest moments of happiness in love—gathering and deepening the qualitative experience of a shared life—cannot be contained in an instant, since the moment is bound up with a network of meaning that extends to the memory of a shared past and anticipations of a future together. As Taylor himself emphasizes: “The deepest, most powerful kind of happiness, even in the moment, is plunged into a sense of meaning,” so that “when you look back on your life together, those happy moments, those travels in the sun, were bathed in the awareness of other years, other travels, which seemed to come alive in the present one.” ([Location 961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=961))
- If you truly believed in the existence of eternity—and in the superior value of eternal life—there would be no reason to mourn the loss of a finite life. Thus, Buddhism teaches that a fully enlightened person is beyond the pain of mourning and loss, having extinguished the desire to hold on to any life that is passing away. The same logic is articulated by the founding figures of Christianity. Saint Augustine forcefully argues against mourning the loss of mortal lives and upon the death of his mother—when he cannot hold back his tears—he condemns his weeping as an act of sin. Martin Luther in his turn declares, upon the death of his daughter Magdalena in 1542, that “I rejoice in the spirit, but sorrow in the flesh,” emphasizing to the congregation after her funeral that “we Christians ought not to mourn.” ([Location 1017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1017))
- Moreover, there would be no motivation to prevent similar events from happening, since there would be no risk against which to offer protection. ([Location 1106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1106))
    - mw:: This is kind of stupid.
- This experience of time is, according to Augustine, at work in every moment of our lives. You may think that you are present here today. But in everything you do, you are divided between the past and the future. As you get up in the morning, part of the day is already gone and what remains of the day is still to come. Even if you wake up at dawn and focus only on the first hour of the day, you will never be able to seize it as a present moment. “An hour,” Augustine writes, “is itself made of fleeting moments. Whatever part of the hour has flown away is past. What remains of the hour is future.” ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1143))

- The result is a life in which opportunity and danger are inseparable. The light of bliss—even when it floods your life—is always attended by the shadow of loss. “Either loss of what we love and have gained,” Augustine explains, “or failure to gain what we love and have hoped for.”5 This is the condition of secular life. Augustine uses the Latin word saecularis to evoke how we are bounded by time, through our commitments to a shared world and history, as well as to generations before and beyond us. ([Location 1176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1176))
- Augustine recognizes that this exposure to loss is an essential part of why we care. Because everything we do and everything we love can come to an end, we are bound to care (curare) and be concerned. ([Location 1229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1229))

- This possibility of failure is intrinsic to the motivational force that sustains my commitment to writing the book. The motivational force depends on my belief in the significance of what I have to say, but it also depends on my belief that I can fail. The belief that I can fail is part of what motivates me to try to succeed, to keep my attention on what I am doing, to improve my arguments and formulations. ([Location 1243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1243))
- In contrast, the aim of Stoicism is to make us independent of everything that may upset us. This requires that we stop believing in the value of anything that can make us suffer. If something is taken away from us, we will not feel bereaved because we are not attached to anything that can be lost. And if someone violates us, we will not be angry or retaliate because we are not attached to any part of ourselves that is vulnerable to harm. Through the practice of detachment, we will maintain peace of mind regardless of what happens. The goal of Stoicism is literally apathy (apatheia): the freedom from all passions, since passions hold us hostage ([Location 1301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1301))
- According to Augustine, you should therefore convert your love for finite beings (cupiditas) into a love of God’s eternal presence (caritas). When you love yourself or extend your love to others, you should not be attached to their finite existence but love God through them. This is the meaning of the Christian imperative to love your neighbor as yourself. ([Location 1313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1313))
- The Buddhist claim is that all experiences of finite life—including our most extraordinary experiences of well-being and bliss—are unsatisfactory, since they are impermanent. Even when they last for a long time, we can lose them at any moment. This is why Buddhism advocates detachment from everything that is impermanent. To be attached to finite life is to put yourself at risk, to expose yourself to being hurt by what happens. In contrast, Buddhism holds that you should detach yourself and aspire to rest in the peace of nirvana. ([Location 1344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1344))

- Only by acknowledging the importance of something beyond your control—that is: only through vulnerability—can you be moved by what happens. The precious quality of joy is inseparable from a sense of its precariousness, and the value of connecting to another person would not be felt without the risk of disconnection.

    - mw:: Doesnt beyond yourself scream religion to some ppl
- Augustine’s official narrative maintains that the God he refused was not the true Christian God he discovered later in his life. But Augustine’s writing also tells another story. The reason he refused to seek comfort in God was not because he had an inadequate understanding of divine eternity, but because he loved his friend—and the life they shared together—as an end in itself. He wanted their lives to go on, rather than ascend to eternity. As Augustine himself makes clear, such secular love is incompatible with a religious love of eternity. A religious love of eternity treats the mortal beloved as a means and must be careful not to love him in his own right. As Augustine explains in the first book of his Confessions, “My sin was in this—that I looked for pleasures, exaltations, truths not in God Himself but in His creatures (myself and the rest), and so I fell straight into sorrows, confusions, and mistakes.” ([Location 1405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1405))

- The decisive aspect of religious conversion, however, is that the secular world is treated as a means and not as an end in itself. If you go to church for the sake of experiencing the warmth of the community—with friends, family, and other members of the congregation—Augustine would reproach you for using the religious ritual as a means for the secular end of maintaining and celebrating social bonds. ([Location 1429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1429))
- While Augustine acknowledges “the great utility of music in worship,” it should only serve as a means and not be enjoyed as a source of pleasure in itself. ([Location 1434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1434))
    - mw:: Music as means
- the bond between love and grief is what I am asking us to see. To pursue this vision would be to write a secular—as distinct from a religious—confession. Such a confession would take up Augustine’s explorations of how the identity of the self depends on the fragile operations of memory and how the experience of time cuts through every moment. Like Augustine in his Confessions it would declare: “See, my life is distended” (Ecce distentio est vita mea).41 But unlike in Augustine, the distention of time would not be regarded as a fallen state from which we need to ([Location 1506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1506))
- The task would be to “own” the fact that this is the only life we have—for better and for worse—rather than seeking to leave this life behind. While Augustine denounces the “glue of care” (curae glutino) that binds us to the world, a secular confession would maintain that it is only through finite bonds that we can seize our lives and become who we are. ([Location 1512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1512))
- You are a potential addressee of his work by virtue of being a time-bound, practically committed agent who can be moved to explore and deepen your commitment to the life you are leading. Knausgaard’s writing can give you new access to your own life not necessarily because you identify with his experiences but because My Struggle exemplifies a devotion to life as it is lived—a devotion that you can take up and practice in relation to your own existence. ([Location 1538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1538))
- He is teaching us (and himself) how we can remember what we tend to forget. ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1545))
- The appeal of Knausgaard’s writing is not that it forces you to see his life with your eyes. Rather, his writing enables you to see your life with his eyes—with the level of attention he bestows on a life. Thereby you can come to recognize the myriad ways in which you are indeed alive, even when you seem dead to yourself or lost in the mundane events of everyday existence. As you take care of the tasks at hand, what you see bears the weight of your love and your evasions, the history of who you have been and may turn out to be.

- Evenings that no one else can remember live in you, when the snow touched your face or the rain caught you unprepared, when you were all alone and yet marked by all the others who have made you who you are.

([Location 1552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1552))
    - mw:: Beautiful
- The animating principle of Knausgaard’s writing is rather one of attachment, which is all the more profound because it remains faithful to the ambivalence of any attachment. The credo of his work, I will show, is a phrase that recurs throughout My Struggle and is difficult to translate. “Det gjelder å feste blikket,” Knausgaard writes in Norwegian. The phrase could be rendered as “one must focus the gaze” or “what matters is to focus the gaze.” But the Norwegian verb that we would then translate as to focus (å feste) literally means “to attach,” and the phrase is clearly a personal injunction rather than a simple statement. So a better translation would be: attach yourself to what you see, focus your gaze by attaching yourself to what you see. This is the imperative of My Struggle.

- to become more attached to the life he is living. This is the third sense of his imperative. You must attach yourself to what you see—even at the cost of suffering—because without attachment there is no meaning: nothing to care for and no one who binds you to the world. To counter such nihilism is the animating ambition of Knausgaard’s secular confession. ([Location 1617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1617))
- Rather, to own our lives is to acknowledge that struggle belongs to the very life we want to lead. If we want our lives to matter, we want to have something that we can lose. ([Location 1641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1641))
- From a religious point of view, a finite life without redemption is indeed soulless and banal. This view is inherited even by many who do not have religious faith—regarding their lives as futile because they lack a sense of the eternal—and Knausgaard is tempted by it in a number of the essayistic reflections that pervade My Struggle. He repeatedly claims that art aspires to retrieve a sense of the holy, while lamenting that we can no longer attain it. “The longing and melancholia that Romantic art expresses is a longing for this,” he writes with reference to a religious sense of the holy, “and a mourning of its loss. At least that is how I interpret my own attraction to the Romantic in art.” ([Location 1668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1668))
- The aim is to attach himself more deeply to his life, rather than transcend it. From this perspective, it is Augustine’s mystical ecstasies that are soulless and banal, since they seek to leave the world behind in favor of an eternal presence where nothing happens. What is profound in Augustine is not the ascent to heaven but the descent into time and memory. It is the latter, descending movement that Knausgaard follows in his practice as a writer. ([Location 1688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1688))
- Knausgaard’s writing develops a careful attention to the time and place where he finds himself. The fundamental form of such attention is the turn toward what is happening at this very moment—trying to capture life as it unfolds right now. The aim is to slow down the experience of temporality, to dilate moments of time and linger in their qualities. This movement does not yield a stable presence but, on the contrary, a stronger sense of how the present moment is ceasing to be and has to be held in memory, as it opens onto a future that exceeds it. ([Location 1713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1713))
- The distention of time—how every moment trembles on the verge of the past and the future—thus appears in the light of secular passion. Distention is not only the negative condition of loss but also the positive condition of wonder. Only someone who is torn open by time can be moved and affected. Only someone who is finite can sense the miracle of being alive. ([Location 1783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1783))
- Rather than a transcendent topic of writing, which has always left Marcel’s imagination blank, it is “this life, the memories of its times of sadness, its times of joy”60 that he comes to see as the basis for his book. “The greatness of true art,” he declares, “lies in rediscovering, grasping hold of, and making us recognize…this reality which we run a real risk of dying without having known, and which is quite simply our life.”61 ([Location 1795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1795))
- The key to breaking habit is to recall that we can lose what we love. Far from devaluing life, the dimension of loss is part of what makes it emerge as valuable. We may know that we are going to die, but the role of art is to make us feel what that means and thereby intensify the commitment to our life.

- Knausgaard thereby reveals a difficulty that Proust tends to conceal. If you focus only on the distant past (as Marcel does), it is relatively easy to gain a new appreciation of your life, since you can transform the past into an object of contemplation that no longer makes any direct demands on your engagement. You can dwell on details you previously overlooked, absorb the impact of events you did not understand at the time, and even feel a surge of nostalgia for things you did not enjoy when you first experienced them. Indeed, the sense that all these things are irrevocably gone can make them appear more precious than they actually were. Your nostalgia, then, can come to shelter you from the demands of a life that still has to be lived. ([Location 1831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1831))
- In contrast, the structure of My Struggle looks like a deliberate inversion of the one that shapes In Search of Lost Time. While Marcel’s book ends with him becoming an author through the decision to write the story of his life, Karl Ove’s book begins with him already being an author who decides to write the story of his life and ends with the declaration that he is no longer an author after the completion of his book. “I will enjoy, really enjoy, the thought that I am no longer an author,” are the last words of My Struggle, followed by a separate page with two sole sentences that address his wife and children: “For Linda, Vanja, Heidi, and John. I love you.” ([Location 1842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1842))
- Yet in Knausgaard there is a strong parallel awareness of how the dimension of lived time—with its hopes and fears, hidden riches and emotional upheavals—depends on a material body that will remain after the distended life has expired. ([Location 1916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1916))
- Presumably, this is why the dead body is so uncanny and tends to be hidden away. The dead body reminds us that we are not only in the world but also of the world, made of materials that will degrade and decompose. ([Location 1941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1941))
- Death is the background against which life can light up as something cherished and irreplaceable, but it is also the background that can extinguish all light: “Death makes life meaningless, because everything we have ever striven for ceases when life does, and it makes life meaningful, too, because its presence makes the little we have of it indispensable, every moment precious.”72 ([Location 1969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1969))
    - mw:: Knausgaard
- While these two perspectives are apparently opposed, they are united in their denial that death entails the loss of a life we should try to hold on to. In the first case, we are told to detach from the life that is lost in favor of an immortal soul. In the second case, we are told to detach from the life that is lost in favor of the continuation of matter. Both perspectives thus deny the tragedy of death. Only a secular faith—which remains committed to a life that irrevocably is lost in death—can counter these two forms of denial. Indeed, only a secular faith can account for why death is a tragic loss at all. The sense of tragic loss depends on keeping faith in the irreplaceable value of a life that is gone forever. Nature does not care whether we live or die, but that makes it all the more imperative that we care and remember what has been taken away. ([Location 1998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1998))
    - mw:: Religious and stoic Perspectivw
- The remarkable thing with Knausgaard’s writing is how the experience of mortality is allowed to be the source of both fear and love, terror and beauty. The anxiety before death is not something that can or should be overcome. Rather, it is an expression of love for a life that will cease to be. ([Location 2012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2012))
- These are all forms of embodied time, through which we distend our lives beyond our physical location in space. At the same time, we are necessarily bound to a physical body. The wager of My Struggle is to hold these two perspectives together. We are spirit but also matter and the former depends on the latter. We can compose our lives—give them form and meaning—but in the end we will disappear in a meaningless process of decomposition. Knausgaard makes us confront such decomposition, while keeping faith in the value of finite existence. He turns us back to our lives to see both form and formlessness, integration and disintegration. ([Location 2044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2044))
- Nazi ideology is thus another version—a particularly sinister version—of the religious longing for purity. Knausgaard acknowledges and reckons with such longing for purity, but his writing is an active resistance to any temptation of purification. Indeed, My Struggle is devoted to the very imperfection that Mein Kampf sets out to erase. Nothing will save us, since irresolution, difficulty, and frailty are essential parts of the lives we care about. ([Location 2063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2063))
- This is why My Struggle—which apparently is so devoted to the I—ultimately turns out to be dependent on you. In turning toward you, Karl Ove exposes himself in his dependence on a world that is beyond his control. But he also trains you to see and to acknowledge your own dependence and the dependence of others. ([Location 2068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2068))
- The story of Abraham’s devotion to God—and the sacrifice of his beloved son Isaac—is both one of the most enigmatic and most poignant episodes in the Bible. Sparsely told as an existential drama of religious faith, it continues to provoke passionate responses and troubled questions. These questions are all the more pressing because Abraham is regarded as the “father of faith” in all three major monotheistic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam). How we understand Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac is therefore a central part of how we understand religious faith. ([Location 2092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2092))
- While these questions have been debated for centuries, no one has pursued them with the philosophical depth and literary imagination of a young Danish philosopher in 1843. During a stay in Berlin, Søren Kierkegaard set out to bring the story of Abraham and Isaac back to life for a contemporary audience. The resulting work is Fear and Trembling, a book that more than any other has made Kierkegaard live on as an author and thinker. Professional philosophers as well as lay readers, religious believers as well as atheists, keep returning to Fear and Trembling as a profound exploration of what it means to have faith. ([Location 2099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2099))
- The greatness of Abraham, according to Fear and Trembling, is that he is not paralyzed by “the anxiety, the distress, the paradox” of having to kill Isaac and instead ventures everything on his faith in God. ([Location 2139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2139))
- Kierkegaard holds that anyone who has a living religious faith must be ready to make such a sacrifice: to give up the finite (Isaac) for the eternal (God). ([Location 2141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2141))
- good place to start is the general definition of faith in Kierkegaard’s Concluding Unscientific Postscript: “Without risk, no faith. Faith is the contradiction between the infinite passion of inwardness and the objective uncertainty.” ([Location 2148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2148))
- Thus, no matter how subjectively certain we may be about what has happened, there is an element of objective uncertainty in our knowledge, since our account of the past cannot ever be definitive and may be refuted. Likewise, we may develop better methods for predicting what will happen, but the future remains objectively uncertain, since we cannot know what has not yet taken place. ([Location 2154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2154))
- These forms of uncertainty mark our experience of the present itself, which is already becoming past and becoming related to the future. A moment is never a still point of certainty but always passing away (Forbigaaende) and opening itself to what may come (Tilkommende). This is why life—in Kierkegaard’s most famous phrase—can only be understood backwards but must be lived forwards. ([Location 2156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2156))
    - mw:: ANicca
- “Passion” and “appropriation” are two of Kierkegaard’s favorite words to describe such a commitment. For an activity to matter in an existential sense, it is not enough that you learn to do it correctly: you have to be passionate about doing it right and appropriate the activity as your own by putting yourself at stake in it. ([Location 2174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2174))
- By committing yourself to a person, a political struggle, or a way of life, you become dependent on something whose continued existence is objectively uncertain. Yet Kierkegaard maintains that it is only through such an existential commitment that you can become a self. Biologically we may be described as human beings, but who we are—our “self” in Kierkegaard’s existential sense—is defined by what we are committed to as well as how we sustain those commitments. ([Location 2189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2189))
- “The earnest understanding,” Kierkegaard writes, “is that if death is night then life is day, that if no work can be done at night then work can be done during the day; and the terse but impelling cry of earnestness, like death’s terse cry, is: This very day.” ([Location 2231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2231))
- This is the blueprint for Abraham’s religious faith in Fear and Trembling. As long as Abraham keeps his faith in God, he is insulated from the actual experience of losing what he loves. For Kierkegaard, this is the deepest virtue of religious faith. As long as you keep religious faith, you cannot be defeated by loss. ([Location 2252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2252))
- In contrast, secular faith necessarily remains vulnerable. As long as you keep secular faith, you can be defeated by loss. Affirming your life-defining commitment as a parent—and loving your child wholeheartedly—does not protect you from the pain of conflict, the bereavement of broken hopes, or the possible devastation of losing your child. On the contrary, it is because you are keeping faith with your child—and holding on to your life-defining commitment as a parent—that you are all the more vulnerable to these experiences. ([Location 2259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2259))
- My secular faith that life is worth living may carry me through devastating experiences, but it is essentially fragile, since I cannot sustain it on my own. My secular faith—my ability to hope for the future—relies on others who recognize me, as well as on my own ability to recognize myself. Even if I am all alone, my own sense of myself is inseparable from how I have been received by others and how they have given me resources to live on. Thus, if my son dies, I may be able to go on with my life despite the terrible grief, but at every step of the way I will depend on the world of which I am a part. If I can recollect my love for my son—if I can recognize myself as a loving father who inadvertently lost his son—I may be able to work through the grief and renew my commitment to the future. The pain will never entirely go away, but the memories of what we shared together may give me sustenance. ([Location 2365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2365))
- The risk of such despair is built into any life-defining commitment. To have a life-defining commitment is to acknowledge that I am not self-sufficient but essentially a relational being. My identity is not given but relies on forms of recognition that must be upheld or transformed and that remain fragile at their core. My life-defining commitments give me a world and an identity, but they also underline my finitude and the risk that my world can break down. ([Location 2376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2376))
- Religious faith thus requires a double movement, whereby you renounce trust in the world in favor of trust in God. Rather than rely on finite relations, you place your faith in God. The first movement of religious faith is what Kierkegaard calls infinite resignation, which plays a central role in Fear and Trembling but is most fully elaborated in the Concluding Unscientific Postscript. Infinite resignation does not mean that you give up hope, but that you renounce all forms of hope that depend on a finite world. ([Location 2383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2383))
- “No merely human love can completely drive out this anxiety, which can very well remain hidden and undetected in the friendly security of a happy life-relationship, but which at times can inexplicably stir deep within and which, when the storms of life begin, is immediately at hand.”35 In contrast, God “remains faithful, every day of your life, whatever happens to you; he remains faithful to you in death; he meets you again in the hereafter as a trustworthy friend.”36 The demanding task is to keep faith in God. As long as you have “given yourself completely to him, had your whole life in him,” he will never let you down, since “he himself eternally guarantees” his own fidelity. ([Location 2427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2427))

- Nothing is accomplished by merely withdrawing to a monastery, since a monastery belongs as much to the world and to finite life as any other place on earth. Anyone who makes the movement of infinite resignation should become “a stranger in the world of finitude,” but he should “not define his difference from worldliness by foreign dress (this is a contradiction, since with that he defines himself in a worldly way).” ([Location 2454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2454))
- We can thus begin to understand why Kierkegaard treats the sacrifice of Isaac as paradigmatic for what it means to have a living religious faith. Even if you do not receive an explicit command from God to sacrifice your son, the absolute telos of eternal happiness requires that you subordinate and ultimately surrender any finite object of your love. This movement of infinite resignation is at the core of what Kierkegaard calls Religiousness A. ([Location 2469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2469))
- The infinite resignation of Religiousness A is thus the common denominator for all forms of religious faith worthy of the name. The reason is simple. If you are not willing to sacrifice the finite for the eternal, your living faith—the faith that is revealed by how you actually respond to what happens—is secular rather than religious. You may profess that you believe in God and eternity, but as long as you are not ready to renounce the finite your supposed religious faith is dead, a matter of mere words. ([Location 2476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2476))
    - mw:: Cf swith eg judaism
- The “true” Abraham, however, makes a second movement simultaneously with the movement of infinite resignation: the movement of faith. This movement holds that everything is possible for God, even if it seems impossible or absurd from a human perspective. ([Location 2489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2489))
- Likewise, Kierkegaard’s modern version of Abraham—the knight of faith—is presented as someone who is utterly committed to finite life. Unlike his counterpart the knight of infinite resignation, who can make only the first movement of renunciation, the knight of faith can make the double movement through which he fully expects to receive the finite even after having given it up. Whereas the knight of infinite resignation becomes “a stranger and an alien”47 in the world of finitude, the knight of faith is described as “the only happy man, the heir to the finite,”48 since he has “this security that makes him delight in finitude as if it were the surest thing of all.”49 ([Location 2495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2495))
- In practice, the one who makes the double movement of religious faith is even more brutally indifferent to the fate of the finite than the one who performs the single movement of infinite resignation. The knight of infinite resignation kills Isaac, but at least he recognizes the loss of Isaac. The knight of faith also kills Isaac, but through the double movement of religious faith he does not recognize the actual loss of Isaac because he is fully confident that he will get him back even though he has taken his life. He can stand there with Isaac’s severed head in his hand and still believe that he will live happily ever after with his son. ([Location 2514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2514))
- At every moment in his sacrifice of Isaac, Abraham has to make both the movement of infinite resignation and the movement of faith. Only through such a double movement can he kill Isaac while at the same time maintaining that he loves him. As long as he makes the double movement, he can never experience the devastating loss of Isaac, since at every moment he renews his faith that his son will be given back to him. This is how Abraham’s love of Isaac becomes an entirely internal affair, where any concern for Isaac in his own right is eliminated. By virtue of his religious faith, Abraham is no longer responsive to what actually befalls Isaac, or to how he may be feeling, except insofar as it aligns with Abraham’s own hopes. The impact of any negative outcome is immediately renounced in favor of the faith that he will receive exactly what he wants, since God can do anything that is needed to arrange it. That is how Abraham sacrifices his care for Isaac. Because Abraham believes that he ultimately cannot lose his son, he can take Isaac’s life. ([Location 2557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2557))
- For Kierkegaard, however, the absurdity is the point, since it underlines that the movement of religious faith requires that you relinquish any concern for external probabilities in favor of internal conviction. “By virtue of the absurd to get everything, to get one’s desire totally and completely”68—that is how Fear and Trembling glosses the religious faith that defies any finite understanding. Rather than “find rest in the pain of resignation,” the knight of faith can “find joy by virtue of the absurd” and “live happily every moment,”69 since “he has this security [faith in the absurd] that makes him delight in finitude as if it were the surest thing of all.”70 ([Location 2647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2647))
- For the same reason, however, the knight of faith is not actually at stake in any of his commitments. If I am at stake in my commitments, then I must run the risk of despair if I betray my commitments or if everything to which I am committed breaks down. The risk of despair is not a possibility that can be eliminated but a necessary boundary condition for any life-defining commitment. If I have a life-defining commitment, there are things I cannot do and a world I cannot lose on pain of losing myself. The knight of faith believes, on the contrary, that he will be able to go on with his life even if everything is taken away from him, and at every moment he overcomes any form of anxiety. ([Location 2692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2692))
- In destroying his ability to be in despair, he is also destroying his ability to care about anyone or anything that is finite. ([Location 2698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2698))
- Yet these characterizations are not meant to repudiate religious faith but to make it appear even more awe-inspiring and sublime. Like many of Kierkegaard’s books, Fear and Trembling is signed by a pseudonymous author—in this case Johannes de Silentio—who narrates the story and speaks directly to the reader. Johannes admits that he himself does not have religious faith and often finds himself “shattered” or “paralyzed” when thinking of Abraham. But this does not prevent Johannes from regarding Abraham as “the greatest of all” and from chastising himself for falling short of the religious faith that is required to sacrifice Isaac. ([Location 2700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2700))
- Those who claim to be Christian but still care about the fate of their finite lives, Kierkegaard chastises for lacking a living religious faith. If you are poor and cannot renounce the care for poverty, if you are dying and cannot renounce the care for your life, if you are a loving parent and cannot renounce the care for your child, then you are not a Christian. You may claim that you trust in God, but if you cannot prove it through your actions and through how you respond to what happens, then your religious faith is dead: something you claim to believe even though it does not actually shape how you think and feel. A living religious faith is rather achieved through a double movement, where you renounce the cares that follow from being finite and instead place your trust in God. Even though you are starving, you believe that you will be nourished, even though you are dying, you believe that you will live forever, and even though you are killing your son, you believe that he will be given back to you. ([Location 2725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2725))
- Only by loving Isaac for his own sake—while recognizing that his life is essentially fragile—can you care for him. And yet it is precisely such care that religious ideals of absolution demand that you give up. ([Location 2744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2744))
- The practice of detachment is a movement of infinite resignation, which requires that you sacrifice your care for the finite in favor of the eternal. In order to be unmoved by what happens, you cannot be responsive to Isaac’s fate. On the contrary, you must remain as insensitive as a mountain. ([Location 2750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2750))
    - mw:: Agreed, but... This is still unsatissfactory to combat maassive metaphoriical wweiht on the ogher siixde
- A father (Abraham/God) sacrifices his beloved son (Isaac/Jesus). In the Binding of Isaac, the son is taken to Mount Moriah, where his father raises a knife to kill him. This prefigures the Crucifixion of Jesus, where the son is nailed to the cross on Golgotha and slowly dies in agony. In both stories the sacrifice is rewarded and praised as a holy act. Because Abraham was ready to kill Isaac, God blesses his descendants; because Jesus died on the cross, mankind is said to be redeemed from sin. ([Location 2768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2768))
- As scholars of the Hebrew text have shown, there are strong indications that in the original version Abraham chooses to protect Isaac’s life in defiance of the divine command. ([Location 2772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2772))
- Abraham is allowed to keep Isaac as a gift from God. There are good textual grounds, however, for regarding the angelic speeches as a later insertion. Both in terms of style and structure, they diverge in striking ways from the rest of the text. Most importantly, if one removes the angelic speeches one will find a consistent narrative where Abraham disobeys God’s command. The angelic speeches would thus have been inserted to cover up Abraham’s disobedience. As Omri Boehm has argued in a careful textual study: “A later redactor interpolated the figure of the angel, thereby shifting responsibility for interrupting the test from Abraham to the angel.” ([Location 2777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2777))
- Yet what Kierkegaard laments as “doubt” with regard to religious faith can just as well be read as an affirmation of secular faith. If Abraham disobeys God, it is because he is committed to Isaac as an end in himself. Moreover, it is because he believes that Isaac can actually and irrevocably die. This is the core of secular faith: what you love is worth fighting for even though it is finite and calls for your care because it is finite. ([Location 2791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2791))
- Thus, in both the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, Jesus’s last words express a sense of utter abandonment: Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? (“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”). After repeating this cry, Jesus gives up his last breath and dies. ([Location 2828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2828))
- The death of Jesus thus leaves itself open to being read in the light of secular passion. On such a reading, Jesus has to be finite—not in order to redeem us from death but in order to be someone who can love and be loved. Recall here the extraordinary sequence in the Gospel of John, when Jesus on the cross says “I thirst,” is given to drink, then says “It is consummated” and dies, with a soldier subsequently thrusting a lance into his side, water and blood pouring out.87 The Christian move is to distinguish this body that is subject to need, dissolution, and decomposition from the “glorious” body of resurrection that is exempt from death. Yet the moment of consummation—of fulfillment of Scripture—is here the moment when the body of the beloved is shown to be a body of flesh and blood. If this body is “resurrected,” it is not because it ascends to heaven or is transformed into an incorruptible body, but because it is commemorated by those who love him, compelled to remember him precisely because he died and thereby allowing him to live on, in a process of communion that itself is subject to dissolution and death. ([Location 2840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2840))
- The death of the beloved is irrevocable—it is a loss that cannot be recuperated—since there is no life other than this life. From a Christian perspective, this is the most devastating scenario. “If there is no resurrection of the dead,” Paul writes in his First Letter to the Corinthians, “and if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain” (1 Cor. 15:13–14). Indeed, Paul emphasizes that “if for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied” (1 Cor. 15:19). If there is no life other than this life—a life that ends in death—then life is vain and futile, according to Paul. All that is left is to “eat and drink, for tomorrow we die” (1 Cor. 15:32). ([Location 2851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2851))
- On the contrary, the peril of death is an intrinsic part of why it matters what we do and why it matters that we devote ourselves to someone or something living on beyond ourselves. We have to take care of one another because we can die, we have to fight for what we believe in because it lives only through our sustained effort, and we have to be concerned with what will be passed on to coming generations because the future is not certain. This is the double movement of secular faith. You run ahead into the risk of irrevocable death—you acknowledge that everything will be lost—and yet you are resolved to make the most of the time that is given. ([Location 2859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2859))
- In The Brothers Karamazov, Dostoyevsky famously claimed that if God does not exist, then everything is permitted. But Fear and Trembling shows that the truth is the other way around. If there is a God for whom everything is possible, then anything can be permitted, even the killing of your own child for no reason other than God’s command. This is the truth that Kierkegaard forces you to confront. If you hold that your responsibility for Isaac is based on God’s command, then you are committed to killing Isaac if that turns out to be the command. ([Location 2880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2880))
- In trying to apprehend a life that is so different from my own, I am reminded that I am both a natural being (in what I take myself to share with the seagull) and a spiritual being (in how I take myself to be different from the seagull). ([Location 2914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2914))
- We are both living beings. As such there is always something at stake for us in our activities. We must do something—acquire nourishment, adapt to our environment—to sustain our lives. ([Location 2917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2917))
- Furthermore, both the seagull and I are responsive to a distinction between appearance and essence, between how we take things and what they turn out to be. If the seagull dives for a fish that it takes to be edible and it turns out to be inedible, the seagull will respond by discarding the fish.

- Nothing that happens to the mountain will ever make a difference for the mountain, since it has no self-relation. For the same reason, the mountain has no capacity for self-movement and self-determination. Because nothing is at stake for the mountain, it cannot do anything and cannot relate to anything as anything. The mountain has no purpose for itself and only acquires one for a living being that makes use of it in some way (as when the seagull lands on the mountain to rest). ([Location 2928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2928))
- These forms of purposive activity can become much more advanced in highly developed animals, but they are all forms of what I call natural freedom. Natural freedom provides a freedom of self-movement, but only in light of imperatives that are treated as given and ends that cannot be called into question by the agent itself. As distinct from natural freedom, spiritual freedom requires the ability to ask which imperatives to follow in light of our ends, as well as the ability to call into question, challenge, and transform our ends themselves. ([Location 2934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2934))
- In engaging the question “what should I do?” we are also engaging the question “who should I be?” and there is no final answer to that question. This is our spiritual freedom. ([Location 2961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2961))
- The difference between natural and spiritual freedom is not a matter of metaphysical substance, but a difference in the practical self-relation exhibited by human beings and other animals. Many kinds of animals exhibit forms of mourning, play, courage, deliberation, suffering, and joy. They may even in some cases (as studies of primates have shown) be able to experience a conflict of choice when certain instincts or loyalties are at odds with one another. Yet no other species we have encountered is capable of transforming its understanding of what it means to be that species. Changes in the environment can cause animal species—or certain members of species—to change patterns in their behavior, but the principles in light of which they act remain the same for as long as the species exist. ([Location 2962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2962))
- In contrast, the understanding of what it means to be human—as manifested in the actual behavior of human beings—varies dramatically across history and across the world at any given moment of history. The difference between a monk who renounces filial bonds for an ascetic life in a monastery and a father who devotes his life to taking care of his children is not merely an individual difference in behavior. Rather, the two forms of life express radically different understandings of what it means to be human. The two men may not only have different degrees of courage, but what counts as courage for them is radically different. They may not only experience different degrees of grief and joy, but what counts as grief and joy for them is radically different. Even the experience of suffering is never merely a brute fact for us as human beings, but an experience we understand and respond to in light of what matters to us. ([Location 2968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2968))
- There is no natural way for us to be and no species requirements that can exhaustively determine the principles in light of which we act. Rather, what we do and who we take ourselves to be is inseparable from a historical-normative framework that must be upheld by us and may be transformed by us. ([Location 2977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2977))
- First, the distinction between natural and spiritual freedom is not a hierarchical distinction. That we are spiritually free does not make us inherently better than other animals, but it does mean that we are free in a qualitatively different sense. Because we can call into question the purposes of our own actions, we can hold ourselves to principles of justice, but we can also engage in forms of cruelty that go far beyond anything observed in other species. Second, the distinction between natural and spiritual freedom does not legitimize the exploitation of other animals. Many contemporary thinkers are critical of any distinction between humans and other animals, since they fear that such a distinction will serve to justify sexism or racism, as well as buttress the mistreatment of other species and the willful extraction of natural resources. Yet such “posthumanism” rests on a conflation of historical facts and philosophical arguments. As a matter of historical fact, it is true that a human/animal distinction often has been employed to classify certain genders or races as “subhuman” and to legitimize ruthless exploitation of the nonhuman world. The critique of such politics is well taken, as is the reminder that we too are animals and dependent on the fate of our environment. However, it does not follow from these facts that any distinction between humans and other animals is illegitimate or politically pernicious. ([Location 2985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2985))
- Natural freedom has a single ought structure, since the agent cannot question its guiding principles and ask itself what it should do. Spiritual freedom, by contrast, is characterized by a double ought structure. As a spiritually free being, I can ask myself what I should do, since I am answerable not only for my actions but also for the normative principles that guide my actions. There are not only demands concerning what I ought to do; there is also the question if I ought to do what I supposedly ought to do. ([Location 3006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3006))
- Death is not a purpose, not a completion or fulfillment of anything, but rather the irrevocable loss of life. The point, however, is that nothing can be at stake in life—that no purpose can matter—without running the risk of death. Life can matter only in light of death. ([Location 3044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3044))
- To be alive is necessarily to have a self-relation, and any self-relation consists in the activity of self-maintenance. Nonliving entities do not have any form of self-relation because they are not doing anything to maintain their own existence. ([Location 3058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3058))
- The first feature we can deduce is that life must be inherently finite. The purposive activity of self-maintenance presupposes that the life of the living being depends on the activity, which is to say that the living being would disintegrate and die if it were not maintaining itself. ([Location 3079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3079))
- The second feature we can deduce is that life must be dependent on a fragile material body. Life cannot be reduced to a specific material substrate, but it requires some form of material body that is in need of self-maintenance. The material body of a life must be fragile, in the sense that it must run the risk of disintegrating or ceasing to function. ([Location 3084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3084))
- The third feature we can deduce is that there must be an asymmetrical relation of dependence between the living and the nonliving. Any form of animation necessarily has a relation to the inanimate (the prospect of its own death), but the inverse argument does not hold. Inanimate matter does not need any form of animation in order to exist. While the living cannot exist without a relation to nonliving matter, nonliving matter can exist without any relation to the living. This is why it is intelligible that a material universe can exist before there are any living beings and why it is intelligible that a material universe can remain after all forms of life are extinguished. The very existence of life is a fragile and destructible phenomenon. ([Location 3088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3088))
    - mw:: Fuck man. Never quite heard it put this way.
- These features of the concept of life make any life intelligible as a life. To be alive is a formally distinctive way of being an entity, which is characterized by the self-maintaining activity of a fragile material being. The concept of life has two genera, which I call natural life and spiritual life. In keeping with the concept of life itself, the genera of life are defined not in terms of material substances or material properties but in terms of two different forms of life-activities. The genera of natural and spiritual life are two formally distinctive ways of being a living being, which are characterized by natural and spiritual freedom respectively. ([Location 3096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3096))
- The first trait of natural freedom is the activity of self-reproduction. Any form of natural life is acting for the sake of self-preservation or the preservation of the species and thereby exhibits a fundamental form of self-determination. The continuous reproduction of the individual organism across a lifetime, as well as its possible replication or procreation in the form of other individuals, are expressions of the natural freedom of self-determination. ([Location 3108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3108))
- There is a vast difference between a plant that can replicate merely by disseminating its seeds, or an insect that necessarily dies in the act of copulation, and an animal that can survive its own act of procreation to live on with its descendants. The latter has a greater capacity for self-determination, since it can care for its own progeny and recognize itself in a generational chain, rather than being immediately subsumed by the reproduction of the species. Yet all these forms of life remain within the bounds of natural freedom, insofar as they cannot call into question the purpose of procreation and cannot transform the given ends of generational life. ([Location 3112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3112))
- The second trait of natural freedom is the ability of a living being to bear a negative self-relation. When faced with adversity, a living being does not passively submit to what happens but engages in some form of active resistance in accordance with its own self-determination. Even in disease or other forms of internal rupture, a living being is not simply negated but maintains itself in the negative experience of suffering. ([Location 3117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3117))
- The third trait of natural freedom is the relation to a surplus of time. The striving self-maintenance of a living being necessarily generates more lifetime than is required to secure the means of survival, so there is at least a minimal amount of “free time” for every living being. The capacity to engage with free time is of course something that varies greatly among different species of natural life. Even a simple plant generates free time in itself, since it does not necessarily have to devote all its time to absorbing the light, water, and other forms of nourishment that are needed for its sustenance. ([Location 3128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3128))
- plant, however, does not have the capacity to use its free time for itself, insofar as there is no activity that is distinct from the activity of self-preservation in the life of plants. In contrast, animals that can play games, explore new aspects of their environment, or be absorbed in purring, have a capacity for self-enjoyment that is distinct from self-preservation. ([Location 3133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3133))
- Yet even animals with highly refined capacities for self-enjoyment remain within the bounds of natural freedom, insofar as they cannot ask themselves how they should spend their time and thereby cannot relate to their time as free. ([Location 3139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3139))
- The genus of spiritual life comprises all species that do have the capacity to ask themselves how they should spend their time. The only known species of spiritual life is human being, but in principle there is nothing that precludes the possibility of discovering or engineering other species of spiritual life.

- The first trait of spiritual freedom is that the purposes of life are treated as normative rather than as natural. As a spiritual being, I am acting not simply for the sake of preserving my life or the life of my species but for the sake of who I take myself to be. Who I take myself to be is a practical identity because it requires that I keep faith with a commitment. For example, if I have a life-defining commitment to a political cause, I take my life to be worth living because I am a political activist. My practical identity gives me a standard of integrity (a norm) in relation to which I understand myself as succeeding or failing to be myself. ([Location 3150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3150))
- In light of my practical identity, I am not just subject to my desires and aspirations but the subject of my desires and aspirations. In living my life I am also leading my life. ([Location 3159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3159))
- The order of priority among a person’s practical identities is what I call her “existential identity.” A person’s existential identity consists in how she prioritizes her practical identities and responds to conflicts between their respective demands. My existential identity—what it means to be “Martin”—is not an additional practical identity, but the constitutive practical activity of striving to hold together an order of priority between my practical identities. In terms of Neurath’s boat, my practical identities are different planks and my existential identity is the boat that holds the planks together in a fragile form. To be someone and do something, I cannot merely have a number of practical identities. There must be a principle of unity—being Martin—that renders my practical identities intelligible as mine and gives them an order of priority in my life.

    - mw:: Psychologically resonates wigh selves
- The second trait of spiritual freedom is the ability of a person to bear a negative self-relation. The negative self-relation may be expressed as a crisis of existential identity—a conflict or breakdown in the relation among my different practical identities—but it also lives within any given practical identity. ([Location 3185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3185))
- Betraying my integrity may in some cases be a fate worse than death, but it is not the same as death. If it were, I would not have to experience the pain of failure, since I would be dead. When I experience the pain of failing to be myself it is rather because I am still alive and trying to lead my life. This is my ability to bear a negative self-relation. Because my identity is practical (a matter of what I do), it can fail or break down. Even the established order of priority among my practical identities—my existential identity—can break down. Planks that hold my boat together can break or fall apart, leaving me shipwrecked. The breakdown of my established integrity, however, is not the end of my life as a person. If I experience the disintegration of the boat, I have not yet drowned and am still trying to hold it together. Being a failed person is still being a person. ([Location 3193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3193))
- Likewise, being a person is not necessarily to succeed in sustaining an existential identity but consists in trying to sustain or to transform my existential identity. When I fail to be the person I am trying to be—when I am shipwrecked—I am not simply negated but the subject of the negative experience of failing to be myself. This possibility of failure is a necessary boundary condition for any practical and existential identity. The prospects of failing to be myself—of losing my integrity, losing my boat, losing my life by drowning—remind me why it matters that I have integrity and that I lead my life. ([Location 3203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3203))
- The ability to bear a negative self-relation makes it possible for me to strive to live up to the demands of a practical and existential identity, even at the expense of great personal suffering. I may persist in being a political activist even though I am beaten, persecuted, and risking my life, thereby demonstrating my spiritual commitment to who I take myself to be. ([Location 3207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3207))
- Striving to be who I take myself to be is not a task that can be completed or a goal that can be achieved. Rather, striving to be myself is intrinsic to any form of practical and existential identity. I cannot have a practical identity without continuing to try to have a practical identity, and I cannot have an existential identity without continuing to try to have an existential identity. ([Location 3212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3212))
- The third trait of spiritual freedom is the ability to ask myself what to do with my time. Like all living beings, I have a surplus of time, but as a spiritual being my relation to the surplus of time is inseparable from the question of how I should spend my time. This is the question that underlies all normative considerations, since what I do with my time is what I do with my life. Every question of what I ought to do—or ought not to do—is ultimately a question of what I ought to do with my time. ([Location 3217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3217))
- As long as my life matters to me, I must be animated by the anxiety that my time is finite, since otherwise there would be no urgency in trying to be someone and trying to do something. Even if my project is to lead my life without psychological anxiety before death, that project is intelligible only because I am anxious not to waste my life on being anxious before death.

    - mw:: Lol but yes
- The decision to end my life does not reflect that my life is complete but that I hold my life to be too short in an existential sense, and indeed so short that there is no time left for me to be who I take myself to be. If my continued life seems too long to bear in an objective sense, it is because I judge that my life is too short to live in an existential sense. ([Location 3252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3252))
- As Rödl underlines in his seminal book Self-Consciousness, we cannot understand how we are material beings if we assume a contemplative standpoint. ([Location 3272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3272))
- A “true” materialism should instead establish how we have a spontaneous, first-person understanding of ourselves as material beings. The understanding of ourselves as material beings is not something that arises when we take up a second- or third-person standpoint on our own bodies. Rather, the understanding of ourselves as material beings is built into our own first-person standpoint. ([Location 3275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3275))
- The deepest reason I am spiritually free is that I can engage the question of what I should do with my time as a question. If there were a given answer to the question, I would not be spiritually free. Who I ought to be and what I ought to do would already be determined. Neither social norms nor natural instincts, however, can by themselves determine what I do. ([Location 3301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3301))
- Secular faith and secular reason are therefore two sides of the same coin. Secular faith has nothing to do with religious revelation or mystical intuition, but is inherent in the structure of a normative commitment. I must keep faith with my commitment as normative—as something to which I am bound—since it only lives in and through me. I can come to question, transform, or betray my commitment, but only in terms of a different commitment with which I keep faith. ([Location 3315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3315))
- My death is therefore the necessary horizon of my life. In spatial terms, the horizon is a condition of possibility for anything to be visible at all. Everything I see, I see against a horizon, which makes it possible to distinguish between proximity and distance: to distinguish between what is close and what is far away. The horizon allows me to discern spatial relations, but the horizon is not itself located at any point in space. No matter how far I walk, I will never arrive at the horizon, since the horizon moves with me. ([Location 3364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3364))
- We can wake up in the middle of the night, asking ourselves what we are doing with our lives. What used to be utterly meaningful can lose its grip and what we do can cease to make sense to us. These forms of existential anxiety can be paralyzing (as in boredom or depression), but they can also transform, change, and reinvigorate our commitments. Existential anxiety is a sign of our spiritual freedom. It is because our fundamental commitments are not given that we can bind ourselves to an ideal rather than a natural purpose. Moreover, it is because our fundamental commitments are trembling and may fall apart that we can even engage the question of what to do with our lives. ([Location 3398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3398))
- Yet the aim of religious faith is to eliminate spiritual freedom in favor of eternal salvation. Rather than hold open the question of what to do with your time, eternal salvation would close down the question completely. Eternal salvation would not allow for any form of spiritual freedom, since it would remove the question of who you should be and what you should do with your time. ([Location 3407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3407))
- It is certainly important to show compassion for those whose suffering leads them to subscribe to a religious ideal of salvation. The right form of compassion, however, is not to promote the promise of eternal bliss but to transform the conditions of social suffering in this life.

- These are not merely theoretical ideas but enacted in practice.

- To be clear, Buddhist meditation practices can certainly be employed to great effect for secular ends. In particular, there has been success in adapting various forms of meditation techniques for cognitive therapy as well as for practical forms of compassion training.23 If you learn Buddhist meditation techniques for such therapeutic purposes—or simply for the sake of having more strength and energy—then you are adapting the techniques for a secular project. You engage in meditational practices as a means for the secular end of deepening your ability to care for others and improving the quality of your life. The religious aim of Buddhism, however, is to release you from life itself. ([Location 3495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3495))

- Both of the children go into the room alone, look at the artwork, and do not touch it. They perform the same action, but their motivations are radically different. The first child chooses to respect the artwork because she understands that something valuable is fragile and depends on her care. This is a secular model of morality, where the child is taught responsibility on the basis of her own freedom and sense of finitude. In contrast, the second child refrains from touching the artwork because she fears punishment and hopes for a reward. This is a religious model of morality, where the child is taught responsibility on the basis of coercion. ([Location 3518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3518))
    - mw:: Study
- The greatest resources for developing a secular notion of freedom can be found in the writings of Karl Marx. This may be surprising, since Marxism is notorious for having given rise to totalitarian regimes in the twentieth century. Yet, as I will seek to show, there is no support in Marx’s thinking for any form of totalitarian state. On the contrary, the premise for all of his work is “the existence of living human individuals”1 as ends in themselves. This commitment to individual freedom—what Marx describes as “the free development of individualities”2—is the foundation for his critique of capitalism and his critique of religion. ([Location 3557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3557))
- The starting point for Marx is what it means that we are living beings. ([Location 3563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3563))
- What Marx calls the realm of freedom is opened up by the capacity of living beings to generate more lifetime than is required to secure the means of survival. ([Location 3568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3568))
- As Marx emphasizes, however, human beings are the only animals who can relate to their activity as a free activity. Other animals are identical with their life-activity, in the sense that they cannot call into question the purpose of what they are doing. Human beings, on the contrary, can transform the purpose of their life-activity. Rather than treat our own survival and the survival of our species as the given end (as the ultimate purpose of our life-activity), we can treat survival as a means toward the end of leading a free, spiritual life. For the same reason, the question of what should count as a satisfying, successful form of life is never finally settled for us. ([Location 3571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3571))
- The ability to engage our life-activity as a free activity is what the young Marx calls the “species-being” (Gattungswesen) of human beings.3 The notion of species-being has often been dismissed as a naive appeal to a supposed human nature or human essence, but such a critique is misleading. The species-being of the human is precisely that we have no given nature or essence. To be sure, Marx holds that labor is a necessary feature of human beings, but for Marx labor does not specify any essential content that would define us once and for all. Rather, “labor” is his term for all forms of purposive activity. Ranging from the most instrumental action to the most elevated spiritual pursuits, labor can be individual and collective, artisanal and artistic, political and philosophical. Labor may be driven by physical need, but it can also be motivated by creative aspirations and communal commitments. While Marx is highly critical of all forms of coerced labor—whether slavery, serfdom, or wage labor—emancipation is a matter of not only being free from work but also of being free to work in light of the ends that matter to us. ([Location 3578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3578))
- Analyses of value and economy must therefore be understood in light of the finitude of time. Any economy is ultimately an “economy of time,” Marx writes in his Grundrisse, since any form of “activity depends on economization of time.”6 This is the argument that I seek to ground on the deepest level. To grasp the stakes and implications of the economy of time, we must proceed from the conditions of intelligibility for spiritual life, which are implicit in Marx’s account but that he himself does not explicitly recognize as such. ([Location 3620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3620))
- Marx’s analysis of economy can be seen to operate on three levels. ([Location 3625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3625))
- The first level is what Marx calls the level of appearance. All economies must appear in some form, and the form of appearance is price. In capitalist economies, price has many forms of appearance—wages are the price paid by the capitalist, profit is the price paid by the worker and consumer, rent is the price paid by the leaser of property, and so on. Even a noncapitalist economy, however, must appear through some form of price. An economy is not intelligible unless there is a cost of production, which means that there must be a price to pay for both parties in an economic transaction. If it did not cost me anything to provide you with something, it would not be intelligible that any price is involved in our transaction. Even when I give you something for free, the mere act of giving it to you must involve a cost for me—if only the cost of the time it takes me to give it to you. My act would not be intelligible as a gift unless giving it entailed a cost for me and just by virtue of recognizing it as a gift you become indebted, even if neither one of us insists on the debt. ([Location 3627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3627))
    - mw:: Hmm cf with gifts and mutual aid
- The measure of value is the second level of Marx’s analysis, which he calls the level of essence. The measure of value is essential, since it determines how we calculate growth in an economy and thereby how we measure the overall wealth in a society. An economy does not grow because there is more money circulating—on the contrary, an economy can be shrinking when there is more money circulating than previously—but because there is an overall increase of value in the economy. The measure of value, then, is the essence of any economy. ([Location 3639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3639))
- For Marx, however, the essence of an economical system—the measure of value—is itself something that can change historically. We can change the essence of our economy (our measure of value) and thereby also change the form in which our economic relations appear. How we organize our economy and how we measure the value of our time are open to historical transformation. ([Location 3644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3644))
- The third level of Marx’s analysis is therefore concerned with the transhistorical conditions for any economy. Transhistorical conditions are not beyond history but rather a feature of every historical epoch. How we organize our lives into an economy of time is historically specific, but that we have to organize our lives into an economy of time is a condition for any form of society. Likewise, how we organize our social relations and how we relate to our embodiment is historically specific, but that we are social beings and that we are embodied are general features of spiritual life. In short, how we exist is historically specific, but that we exist as historical beings—finite, embodied, and social—is a condition for every moment of history. There has never been and there will never be a historical epoch that does not require some form of economy of time, some form of labor, some form of social relations, some mode of producing and reproducing life.

- There are many things I believe are valuable, but only a few things that I am valuing in the sense of making them a priority in my life. For example, I believe that the discipline of medicine is highly valuable, but it is not a priority in my life to be a doctor. By contrast, in valuing the life of my child—even and especially because the life of my child is invaluable to me—I am not merely avowing a belief. I am expressing a commitment to which I hold myself and that places demands on me. ([Location 3689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3689))
- To value someone or something is to put myself at stake in what happens to what I value. By virtue of my commitment, I cannot be indifferent but must be responsive to the fate of what I value. Even when I believe that something is valuable without being directly involved with it—e.g., the discipline of medicine—I have to be willing to do something on its behalf. Indeed, if the discipline of medicine were threatened, I would be compelled to do what I can to save it. If I am not willing to do or say anything to defend the discipline of medicine, I do not actually believe that it is valuable. ([Location 3693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3693))

- To value something, I have to be prepared to give it at least a fraction of my time. This is why finite lifetime is the originary measure of value. The more I value something, the more of my lifetime I am willing to spend on it.

- My distinction between the realm of necessity and the realm of freedom hinges on two different relations to the time that is required for an activity. Let me take a simple example. I have to drink water to stay alive. If I am required to walk two hours per day to acquire water from a distant well, my activity is in the realm of necessity, since the time I spend walking to the well is not valuable in itself but merely a means for the end of sustaining my life. If I could reduce the necessary labor time by having running water in my house, I would do so. Inversely, if I enjoy walking two hours per day as an intrinsic part of a fulfilling life, my activity is in the realm of freedom, since the time I spend walking is valuable for its own… ([Location 3709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3709))
- The activity in question can belong either to the realm of necessity or the realm of freedom, depending on the… ([Location 3716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3716))
- How we distinguish between the realm of necessity and the realm of freedom is never settled once and for all, but we have to make the distinction for there to be a question of freedom in our lives. If I treated all my activities merely as means—if nothing I did counted as valuable in itself for me—I could not lead a life, since my life would have no purpose internal to its own activities. Inversely, if I treated everything I do as valuable in itself, I could not lead a life either, since whatever I do would be an essential part of the purpose of my life and there would be no question of what I ought to do with my life. ([Location 3721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3721))
- The correlation between labor time and value holds for all the objects I produce or acquire in the realm of necessity. The time I spend on securing the objects I need is not valuable in itself, so their value is determined by how much lifetime it costs me to generate and maintain them for consumption. ([Location 3735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3735))
- The preferred form of labor in the realm of necessity is therefore what Marx calls “dead labor.” Dead labor designates work that is already done and stored up for future use. A bottle of water that I have brought back from the well contains a certain amount of completed (“dead”) labor, and its value is determined accordingly. More generally, the practical know-how that I have acquired through repeated practice is a form of objectified, past labor that I can draw on without having to start from the beginning every time I have to do something. Most importantly for Marx, all kinds of material technologies are forms of dead labor, since technologies allow us to get things done more efficiently while reducing the amount of living labor involved in the process. ([Location 3737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3737))
- The rational aim, then, is to reduce the realm of necessity and increase the realm of freedom. The less time we must devote to activities that are merely means to an end, the more time we can devote to activities that for us are ends in themselves. What those activities are is not a given, and part of living in the realm of freedom is having time to develop or transform our conceptions of what makes life worth living. In the realm of freedom my activities are ends in themselves—including the activity of interrogating what should count as an end in itself—since I pursue the activities on the basis of my commitments rather than because of material need or coercion. ([Location 3744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3744))
- The measure of value is thus different in the realm of freedom than in the realm of necessity. The value of an object or an activity in the realm of freedom is not directly correlated with the amount of labor time required to produce or maintain it. Rather, the value of an object or an activity depends on my normative commitments. ([Location 3748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3748))
- In the realm of freedom, the value of my chapter is determined by the degree to which it answers to what I think the chapter ought to be. If I manage to produce a profound argument quickly, it is worth more than a mediocre claim that took me a long time to articulate. ([Location 3752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3752)) ^3b4885
- For the same reason, the time we spend in the realm of freedom is not normatively understood as a negative “cost” for which we should be compensated. Rather, spending time in the realm of freedom is a value in and for itself. In the realm of freedom, value is not measured by accumulated, dead labor time but by how much time we have to lead our lives. The more free time we have to pursue the activities that matter to us, the wealthier we are. ([Location 3755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3755))
- It is because I positively value my own free time that I can count it as a negative cost when I have to spend time on something that is merely a means to an end. ([Location 3764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3764))
- Thus, when we discuss who should walk to the well to retrieve the water we need, we are discussing how we should divide our time between the realm of necessity and the realm of freedom. This discussion—and the economic arrangements that follow from it—is only intelligible because we value our own free time. ([Location 3767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3767))
- Accordingly, when I say that the rational aim is to increase the realm of freedom and decrease the realm of necessity, I am not imposing an external standard of rationality. Anyone who is committed to being an agent is committed to increasing her realm of freedom and decreasing her realm of necessity. Even someone who claims that she wants to devote her life to servitude can do so only by invoking servitude as her free choice and thus defining servitude as belonging to her realm of freedom. ([Location 3769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3769))
- However partial the work of emancipation remains—and however hypocritical it may be that formally egalitarian societies tolerate so much actual unfreedom—no progress would have been possible without the appeal to individual freedom. The reason that actual unfreedom is even intelligible to us as hypocrisy—as an opportunity for critique—is our collective commitment to freedom. It is easy to forget that such a commitment is a fragile and unprecedented historical achievement. In previous periods of human history, there was no such commitment but only forms of reigning tribal norms, according to which there are “natural” slaves or “naturally” subordinated groups who have no claims on those in power.

- Classical liberal theories that are committed merely to a formal or legal notion of freedom—a mere right to freedom—have long been criticized for depriving the idea of freedom of any real content. My legal right to liberty is of little value if I do not have the means to lead my life and make use of my freedom. These means include an education that opens me to a range of possible ways of leading my life, as well as sufficient material resources to reduce the time I have to spend on securing my survival and allow me time to engage the question of what I should do with my freedom. As the liberal philosopher Isaiah Berlin points out, the value of freedom depends on “adequate conditions for the use of freedom.” ([Location 3823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3823))
- Marx regards the basic social form that provides the framework for all liberal reflections on freedom—capitalism—as itself inimical to the actualization of freedom. Liberal theories may advocate various forms of restrictions on capitalism, but they never call into question the social form of capitalism itself. In contrast, Marx argues that the commitment to freedom is betrayed by the social organization and division of labor that is enforced by capitalism. Most fundamentally—I will show—the measure of value and social wealth under capitalism directly contradicts the value of free time.

- Hegel’s radical philosophical claim is that the Idea of freedom is inseparable from material and social practices. The Idea of freedom is not abstract but must be embodied in concrete institutional practices in order to be an Idea of freedom. To use Hegel’s favorite word, the Idea of freedom must be wirklich—actual, real, effective, at work—which requires that we sustain institutions that recognize the freedom of everyone to lead their own lives. ([Location 3860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3860))
- Our practical identities are inseparable from the society to which we belong. If we live and work in a society in which the dominant way of relating to one another is to compete for resources, we will understand ourselves primarily as creatures who are competing for resources. Our apparently natural egoism is itself a matter of our social formation. If we see ourselves as atomistic individuals who form an aggregate in society—with each of us driven to pursue an egoistic end—it is not because we are an aggregate of atomistic individuals as a matter of natural fact, but because we are socialized into a world where we treat and acknowledge one another as though we were atomistic individuals who are naturally driven to pursue an egoistic end. ([Location 3877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3877))
- The conflation of the form of self-satisfaction with the content of egoistic enjoyment is a category mistake, with a clear provenance in the religious notion of original sin. The problem is not that we are committed to self-satisfaction. All of us deserve to lead satisfying lives. The decisive issue is what counts as self-satisfaction for us. ([Location 3882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3882))
- For Hegel, an actual free society is one in which we can recognize our commitment to the common good as the condition of possibility for our own freedom. Rather than seeing the laws of the state as imposed on us and as coercively restricting our self-interest, we should be able to see ourselves as bound to the laws of the state by virtue of our own commitment to lead a free life, which requires that the laws of the state in turn are seen as contestable and transformable by us. This mutual recognition of the state and the individual is the condition for actual freedom. As Hegel emphasizes, “the Idea of freedom is truly present only as the state.” ([Location 3889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3889))
- we do not have to accept Hegel’s historically specific conception of the state. We only have to grasp the necessity of some form of collective self-legislation for any exercise of individual freedom to be possible. ([Location 3894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3894))
- Participation in a state—in the sense of a collective form of life—is not optional; it is an originary and irreducible condition for all spiritually free beings, who are constituted by socially instituted norms from the beginning. The question is which kind of state is required for actual freedom and mutual recognition. ([Location 3896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3896))
- For the same reason, the institutional formation of freedom is not a matter of imposing externally motivated laws and rules on subjects in order to make them obedient citizens. On the contrary, it is matter of providing forms of education—and other institutional practices—that enable persons to be citizens who can understand the norms to which they are subjected as ones to which they have bound themselves; to be citizens who are internally motivated in their actions and who can justify what they are doing to themselves as well as to others. ([Location 3903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3903))
- The question, then, is whether the modern state and the market economy on which it depends are compatible with an “actual” (wirklich) free society. This is the critical question that Marx poses to Hegel, but it has to be posed in the right way. Marx’s own critique of Hegel is not as powerful as it could be, since he does not grasp Hegel’s philosophical logic. Marx assumes that Hegel is imposing an “abstract” Idea of freedom on society in order to justify the state protection of capitalist property rights and the exploitation of wage labor. ([Location 3918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3918))

- Hegel’s notion of the rabble refers to any social group that cannot recognize the demands of society as their own. Hegel’s main example of the rabble are those who are left suffering from poverty by the market economy of civil society. ([Location 3928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3928))
- Hence, the critical question is whether a capitalist society can avoid the production of a rabble and embody the commitment to the freedom of all in its institutional rationality. While Hegel’s answer is yes, his own analysis of civil society confirms Marx’s argument for why the answer is no. ([Location 3940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3940))
- “The livelihood and welfare of individuals should be secured,” Hegel emphasizes, “i.e. particular welfare should be treated as a right and duly actualized.”18 Particular welfare is here not merely a matter of basic sustenance, but of having the social possibilities to lead a free life that can be recognized as dignified by oneself and by those whom one recognizes in turn. The commitment to the welfare and dignity of each citizen is contradicted, however, by the dynamic of wage labor that is the condition for producing social wealth under capitalism. As Hegel points out, the market economy of civil society can provide only two possible solutions to the problem of poverty and unemployment, with both solutions being fundamentally unsatisfactory. ([Location 3943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3943))
- On the one hand, the poor can be supported by charity or public welfare provisions, but this is ultimately inadequate, since it does not allow for the social recognition of having a meaningful profession through which one contributes to one’s own well-being and to the common good of the society to which one belongs. On the other hand, the livelihood of the poor can be provided by the creation of more paid employment—more wage labor—“which would increase the volume of production” in civil society.20 Yet, as Hegel perceptively observes, “it is precisely in overproduction and the lack of a proportionate number of consumers who are themselves productive that the evil consists, and this is merely exacerbated by the two expedients in question.” ([Location 3950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3950))
- Marx’s critique of capitalism is therefore best understood as motivated by a commitment to making the Idea of freedom actual.25 The comparison between wage labor and slavery, which Marx often invokes, is illuminating here. As Hegel was well aware in his own time, the professed commitment to the Idea of freedom (“all are free”) did not prevent allegedly democratic states from maintaining the institution of slavery. The crucial point for Hegel, however, was that the historical achievement of the Idea of freedom made it possible to recognize slavery as a contradictory and self-undermining social form, which must be overcome for us to be true to our Idea of who we are. Likewise, Marx argues that wage labor is a contradictory and self-undermining social form, which must be overcome for us to achieve actual freedom and equality. ([Location 3971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3971))
- There are many who would respond by saying that our economic and social life simply could not function without wage labor. One should remember, however, that the same argument used to be made with regard to slavery. Even many prominent thinkers who acknowledged negative and regrettable aspects of slavery still held the institution of slavery to be a necessity, without which a free society would fall apart. The idea that the enslavement of some is necessary for the freedom of others could only be overcome by disclosing—from within a historical form of life—other possibilities of living and working together. ([Location 3977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3977))
- In principle we are all equal under capitalism, in the sense that no one has a given right to dominate anyone else. Power hierarchies are established through the relation between buyer and seller, capitalist and worker. But there is no divine or natural order that entitles anyone to occupy (or excludes anyone from occupying) one position rather than another. ([Location 3998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3998))
- Second, each participant in an economic relation under capitalism is formally recognized as free. Unlike the system of slavery in Ancient Greece and Rome, or the system of serfdom in the Middle Ages, no one has the right to own another person’s life under capitalism. Of course, as a matter of historical fact, many capitalist societies have nevertheless allowed for various forms of slavery. ([Location 4007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4007))

==When I sell my labor time to someone else for a wage, I am therefore necessarily selling my own life. My time cannot be separated from my life, and under capitalism my time is explicitly recognized as valuable.== ([Location 4013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4013)) ^fe8572

- While we are formally recognized as equal, we are still unequal from the beginning, since the relation of power between us depends on how much property and capital we have inherited. If I own means of production, I can employ you for a wage and make a profit that in turn increases my capital. Whereas ==if you do not own means of production, you have no choice but to sell your labor time either to me or to some other capitalist (==unless you “choose” not to live at all). While you are formally recognized as free, you are effectively forced to labor for the sake of someone else’s profit in order to survive. Instead of religion or nature, economic relations now serve as the justification for the subordination of one person by another. ([Location 4016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4016))
- The general form of a commodity is not specific to capitalism, but pertains to anything that has both a use value and an exchange value. The use value of a commodity is the purpose it serves, which means that a commodity can have multiple use values. The use value of a gallon of water, for example, can be to replenish someone who is thirsty, clean someone who is dirty, wash clothes or dishes, grow vegetables, and so on. The exchange value of a gallon of water, however, is not concerned with its specific use value but is determined by a comparison to the value of other commodities. ([Location 4028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4028))
- The profound question is how to understand the measure of value in exchange value. As Marx reminds us in Capital, Aristotle was the first to raise this question in a rigorous form. “There can be no exchange,” Aristotle points out, “without equality, and no equality without commensurability.”28 To exchange a gallon of water for a pair of shoes we must be able to compare their value, even though a gallon of water is incomparable to a pair of shoes. Aristotle himself concedes that he cannot see how there can be a real basis for such a comparison. “In reality, it is impossible,” he asserts, “that such unlike things can be commensurable,” so he reduces the measure of exchange value to “a makeshift for practical purposes.”29 In contrast, Marx emphasizes that there is a real measure of value for exchange value, namely, labor time. The one thing that all commodities have in common—and that makes it possible to compare their value—is that they cost labor time to produce. ([Location 4039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4039))
    - mw:: Side note q, will ai and robotics change this? Gtedchnologgy etc
- According to Marx, Aristotle was unable to grasp the measure of value in exchange value because he lived in a society that was founded on slave labor. A commodity produced by a slave is not recognized as having “cost” labor time, since the slave is not granted any ownership of his time. The general value of labor time can be recognized only in a society where each participant in the process of exchange—and each producer of a commodity—is held to be equal. ([Location 4049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4049))
- This is one of many passages where Marx makes clear that his own insights would not be possible without the historical emergence of capitalist economic relations and the notion of equality that is intertwined with them. Even before capitalism, labor time was implicitly the measure of value in exchange—otherwise it would be impossible to compare the “cost” of two different commodities—but only with the advent of capitalism is labor time explicitly the measure of value in exchange. The latter transformation requires not only that each person be recognized as equal but also that each person be recognized as free to spend her own time. Only the recognition that we have free time—and that our free time is inherently valuable for us—can make our labor intelligible as a cost and bestow value on the products of our labor. This is one of my central arguments, which is merely implied by Marx’s analysis but required for it to make sense. The social form that recognizes the general right to free time under capitalism is wage labor. The institution of wage labor acknowledges that when I work for my subsistence I am operating in a realm of necessity, where my labor counts as a negative “cost” for which I am compensated with a wage. By the same token, it is acknowledged that wage labor is a means for the end of leading my life in a realm of freedom that opens up beyond my working hours. My wage is literally a means for my subsistence, which is supposed to give me free time to pursue the projects and commitments that matter to me (otherwise there would be no institutional difference between wage labor and slavery). Yet, as Marx maintains, the promise of freedom through wage labor is necessarily betrayed by the social form of wage labor itself. ([Location 4060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4060))
- The cost of producing labor-power is therefore inseparable from the cost of reproducing the life of the worker, granting him enough food, sleep, and other means of subsistence to ensure that he can continue to labor. This is why the rate of wages is essentially related to the average cost for the means of subsistence in a society at a given time. For capitalism to reproduce itself day after day, it must provide the means for workers to reproduce themselves, so that they can generate both their own labor-power for tomorrow and children who can become workers the day after tomorrow. As Marx explains: “The labor-power withdrawn from the market by wear and tear, and by death, must continually be replaced by, at the very least, an equal amount of fresh labor-power. Hence the sum of the means of subsistence necessary for the production of labor-power must include the means necessary for the worker’s replacements, i.e., his children.” ([Location 4101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4101))
- The investment in labor-power is generally a profitable investment because living beings generate more lifetime—and therefore more labor-power—than it costs to maintain them. This is the origin of the surplus value that is transformed into capital. The value that the average worker can produce in an hour of labor is greater than the cost of maintaining the life of the average worker for an hour of labor. How much greater the value is relative to the cost depends on numerous factors, but that the value produced by labor is greater than the cost of labor is necessary for there to be an increase of wealth in capitalist economies. Even after all the additional costs of production and retail have been factored in, there must be a surplus value that is generated by the activity of living labor—otherwise there would be no overall profit in the system, no “growth” in the economy. Moreover, the surplus cannot go back to the worker himself but must be reinvested and accumulated as capital by the owner of the means of production. ([Location 4109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4109))
- The value of a gallon of water is not determined by the quantity of time it takes for you as a particular worker to produce it, but by the quantity of time it takes for the average worker under current societal conditions of production (the socially necessary labor time), which in our case is one hour for one gallon of water. If it takes you more time than the socially necessary labor time to deliver a gallon of water (if you are slower than the average worker), my profit decreases and may even dwindle away altogether. Inversely, if it takes you less time than the socially necessary labor time (if you are faster than the average worker), my profit increases and I can stay in business. ([Location 4123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4123))
- The reason that I am driven—as a capitalist employer—to press more labor out of my workers is therefore not primarily a matter of psychology or individual vice. Before Marx, socialist writers tended to portray capitalists as evil villains who exploit workers out of greed, as though the problem were one of morality. In contrast, Marx shows that the dynamic of exploitation is intrinsic to the social form of capitalism itself and not reducible to individual vice or virtue. ([Location 4128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4128))
- Yet, to reduce the issue to individual choice and character is to disregard how exploitation is systemic under capitalism. As an individual consumer, I can choose not to buy certain products, but without a collective transformation of the system of exchange I will continue to participate in capitalist exploitation. Likewise, as a capitalist employer, I will go out of business and find myself consigned to wage labor if I do not extract surplus value from my workers. As a wage laborer, finally, I have no choice but to submit to a capitalist employer if I want to make a living and survive.

- Relative surplus value concerns the difference between the wage I have to pay my workers for one hour of labor and the value my workers can produce during one hour of labor. The development of technology is the best way to increase relative surplus value, since with a more efficient technology I can make my workers produce more value in less time and keep their wages down at the same time. ([Location 4179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4179))
- When my workers produce a gallon of water twice as fast thanks to a new technology, the value of a gallon is reduced by half. To produce the same amount of value, my workers are now producing twice as much water during one hour of labor. As a consequence, a gallon of water is cheaper to buy in the village. The average cost of living for my workers is decreased and their wages lowered (or at least limited in their increase) while still allowing them to attain their necessary means of subsistence. The result is an increase in relative surplus value. ([Location 4182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4182))
- With every advance in technology, our workers can produce more in less time and the relative surplus value is converted into capital that in turn is invested in the development of even more advanced technologies. The wheels are spinning, but the collateral effects are making themselves felt in our village. Given the more efficient technology, fewer workers are required in the production process and we are faced with growing unemployment. The workers who lose their jobs join an increasing surplus population that has to move between temporary employments and accept lower wages to make a living at all. For me and the other capitalists, this is an advantageous situation, since it allows us to decrease or at least keep down the general level of wages.

- The contradiction in the capitalist mode of production is now apparent in our village. Capitalism can sustain itself only by extracting more and more relative surplus value, which is why we are committed to an annual growth of value. The extraction of relative surplus value depends on continually reducing the socially necessary labor time, which is accomplished by technological progress. The reduction of the socially necessary labor time could lead to more free time for everyone, but under capitalism that is not possible, since surplus time must be converted into surplus value. The reduction of the socially necessary labor time—which could be liberating—instead leads to a fatal contradiction.

- The most fatal mistake in reading Marx—a mistake as prevalent among his followers as among his critics—is to think that he accepts a general labor theory of value, which holds that labor is the necessary source of all social wealth. Such a theory was first formulated by the classical political economists Adam Smith and David Ricardo and supposedly further developed by Marx. For Smith and Ricardo, labor as the essential measure of value is a transhistorical fact. They assume that labor has always been and will always be the source of social wealth. ==For Marx, by contrast, socially necessary labor time as the measure of value is specific to the commodity form and becomes the essence of value only in the capitalist mode of production==. ==Labor time as the measure of value is not transhistorically necessary but the historically specific essence of capitalism, which is contradictory and can be overcome==.

- What is known as the marginalist revolution of neoclassical economics seeks to explain the value of commodities not in terms of labor time but in terms of supply and demand. The supply and demand theory is the one that every student learns in an introductory course to economics. The theory shapes virtually the entire field and serves as an alibi for dismissing—without ever really engaging—Marx’s systematic analysis of capitalism. ([Location 4242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4242))
- According to the supply and demand model of neoclassical economics, the demand for a commodity is determined neither by the amount of labor time required to produce the commodity nor by its overall utility, but by the “marginal utility” it has for the person who buys the commodity. ([Location 4245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4245))
- If we were able to transform carbon into diamonds through a simple operation, the marginal utility of diamonds would fall, since the socially necessary labor time for producing diamonds would diminish. Likewise, if we were deprived of our water supplies and had to walk for hours to acquire a gallon of water, the marginal utility of water would rise, since the socially necessary labor time would increase.

- Something can be scarce or abundant only for someone who stands to win or lose the time to lead a life that matters to her. The very notion of an opportunity cost—which is of central importance in neoclassical economics—is intelligible only for someone who values her own finite lifetime. This is why the marginal utility of water increases dramatically when the objective social conditions for producing water break down. ([Location 4269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4269))
- The value you place on water is not simply a subjective preference but essentially related to the scarce or abundant supply of water, which depends on the objective conditions for producing water in the society of which you are a part. You cannot determine the marginal utility of water except in relation to the socially necessary labor time, which is a matter of how much time it takes on average to produce water in the society to which you belong.

- Marx is not arguing that the actual price of a commodity is directly correlated with the amount of labor time required to produce it. ==The price of a commodity can vary depending on a number of factors, but its value is measured by the cost of socially necessary labor== time. Neoclassical economists deny such a distinction between price and value, in spite of the fact that their own account of marginal utility presupposes the measure of value in terms of socially necessary labor time.

- As living beings, we produce more lifetime than the amount of time it “costs” to keep ourselves alive. Thus, we have a surplus of time that can be sold in the form of labor-power. If we did not generate a surplus of lifetime we would have no labor-power to sell—since all our time would be consumed by the activity of merely staying alive—and nothing could be gained from employing us. Inversely, because we continually generate a surplus of time, a capitalist employer can in principle extract a surplus value by purchasing our labor-power for a wage. ==For the surplus value of our labor to be converted into profit, however, we must not only produce but also consume commodities, not only sell our labor-power but also buy the products of labor for more than it cost to produce them. The resulting profit for capitalist employers is the source of capital growth==. ([Location 4290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4290))
- ==The dynamic of [[wage labor]] thus defines all forms of [[capitalism]], since wage labor for the sake of profit is the condition of possibility for generating capital wealth==. Only the employment of living beings who both produce and consume commodities can give rise to a surplus of value—an overall “growth” of capital wealth—in the economy. This is why living labor time is the source of value in a capitalist economy and why socially necessary labor time is the measure of value for commodities.

- Hence, my argument that finite lifetime is the originary measure of value makes it possible to pursue a critique of neoclassical economics on its own terms, while defending Marx’s arguments and developing their implications. Marx’s account powerfully demonstrates that the measure of value under capitalism is contradictory and traces the pernicious practical consequences of the contradiction. To understand why the measure of value under capitalism is contradictory, however, requires a level of analysis that Marx does not explicitly provide.

The only way we can extract value from the well is by extracting surplus value from a person who has to operate the well in order to make a living. This is a direct consequence of measuring value in terms of labor time. If the quantity of labor time determines our wealth, then a machine that reduces the labor time reduces our wealth—unless we make up for the decrease in necessary labor time by increasing the amount of surplus labor time for the worker. The exploitation of workers is necessary under capitalism, since only the extraction of surplus value can generate any form of social wealth.

Capitalism employs the measure of value that is operative in the realm of necessity and treats it as though it were a measure of freedom.

Of course, individual capitalists may be wealthy enough to “waste” part of their capital on disposable time, but that is beside the point, since the principle of their wealth still requires that they adopt their wealth as an end in itself rather than as a means to leading a free life. The point of wealth under capitalism is to accumulate more wealth, not to use it as a means for a meaningful end.

==- The point of expanding the realm of freedom is not to decide in advance which activities should count as free, or to prescribe that living labor must be replaced by dead labor to the maximum degree possible. On the contrary, the point of expanding the realm of freedom is to enable these questions to be genuine questions—the subject of individual and collective deliberation—rather than being determined for us by our material conditions.

- There are no given answers to these questions of our practical and existential identity, which is why the actualization of freedom requires that we have the time and the material resources to engage them as the demanding questions that they are. Having the time and the resources cannot guarantee that we will engage with the questions in a productive way—there can be no such guarantee precisely because we are free to fail—but the point is that we should collectively enable rather than disable one another to lead a free life. This is the point of the revaluation of value. ([Location 4403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4403))
- The key text for the revaluation of value in Marx is the seventh notebook of his Grundrisse, written in London in the winter and spring of 1858. During this period Marx’s own personal poverty deprived him of free time to work during the day and he had to stay up through the nights to pursue his research, while battling both illness and the stress of trying to support his family. ([Location 4412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4412))
- On a few luminous pages, Marx here captures the central contradiction of capital.38 The contradiction explains why capitalism potentially liberates free time for all, but also enables us to see why only the overcoming of capitalism actually can convert the value of free time into real social wealth. ([Location 4417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4417))
- Indeed, Marx underlines that capitalism “creates the material means and the nucleus for relations,” which could lead to “a higher form of society, with a greater reduction of the overall time devoted to material labor.”40 By demonstrating that we can dramatically reduce socially necessary labor time, the technological advances achieved under capitalism could contribute to an expansion of “the true realm of freedom, the development of human abilities as an end in itself.”41 Nevertheless, under capitalism we cannot directly devote ourselves to an expansion of the realm of freedom, since there is no other measure of social wealth than the surplus value extracted from living labor. No matter how advanced our technological capacities for production become, capitalism must continue “to use labor time as the measuring rod for the giant social forces thereby created,”42 since there is no other source for the growth of capital than the surplus time of living labor. ([Location 4427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4427))
- As long as we measure our social wealth in terms of labor time, technological development is bound to intensify exploitative methods for extracting relative surplus value from workers. Due to increased technological efficiency in the process of production, workers either become unemployed and part of an army of surplus labor whose presence can be used to keep down wages (as tends to happen in the Western world today), or they become subjected to extremely cruel working conditions that are designed to extract as much surplus value as possible from their labor (as tends to happen in the parts of the world where we now locate most of our manufacturing). ([Location 4437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4437))
- the contradiction of capital bears an emancipatory potential within itself. The more advanced our technological powers of production become, the more manifest it becomes that labor time is an inadequate measure for social wealth. When the process of production is increasingly automated and the need for living labor reduced, “the human being comes to relate more as a watchman and regulator to the production process itself.”43 This is potentially emancipatory, since it can lead us to develop ourselves as “social individuals.” For us to become truly social individuals in Marx’s sense, we have to be the subjects of production—planning and directing it for our purposes—rather than being subjected to production for the sake of capital. “In this transformation,” Marx writes, “what appears as the great foundation of production and wealth is neither the immediate labor performed by the worker nor the time that he works, but rather the appropriation (Aneignung) of his own general productive power, his understanding of nature and his mastery over it by virtue of his existence as a social body—in a word, the development of the social individual.”44 ([Location 4442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4442))
- Strikingly, Marx uses the English term disposable time in italics in the original (rather than the German verfügbare Zeit). The social transformation that Marx advocates requires the revaluation of value. “It is no longer,” Marx emphasizes, “labor time that is the measure of wealth, but rather disposable time.”47 What Marx here describes as disposable time is what I call socially available free time. ([Location 4458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4458))
- Socially available free time is thus both the means and the end of emancipation, since it allows for “the free development of individualities,” which Marx specifies as “the artistic, scientific etc. development of individuals in the time set free, and with the means created, for all” (emphasis added).49 ([Location 4465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4465)) ^64ffe3
- Capitalism thus creates the material conditions that make it possible to “blow up”51—in die Luft zu sprengen—its own foundation. Yet, in the Grundrisse, Marx elides the question of what is required of us to make use of this explosive power in an enabling rather than disabling way. He merely emphasizes that “the theft of alien labor time, on which the present wealth is based, appears as a miserable foundation in face of this new one, created by large-scale industry itself. As soon as labor in its direct form has ceased to be the great source of wealth, labor time ceases and must cease to be its measure.”52 ([Location 4471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4471))
- Labor time should therefore cease to be the measure of social wealth, but whether or not it will cease to be the measure of wealth depends on whether we pursue a collective transformation of our conception of value. To say that labor time must cease to be the measure of wealth can either be read as the statement of an inevitable necessity (i.e., the dynamic of capitalism automatically leads to its own overcoming) or as an injunction to us—stating that we must revalue our conception of value. ([Location 4482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4482))
- Marx has often been read as advocating the first alternative (the overcoming of capitalism as historically inevitable), but that is a serious mistake. If the overcoming of capitalism is historically inevitable, then Marx’s own analysis is unnecessary, since the dynamic of material forces alone will secure the overcoming of capitalism, independently of what we are committed to, what we value, and what we understand about the world in which we live. Inversely, the revaluation of value requires not only a theoretical but also a practical transformation of the way we reproduce our lives.

- emancipation of the forms of the state. To recall, there can be no spiritual life without some form of the state: some form of institutional organization of our life-activities governed by norms to which we have bound ourselves. As spiritually free beings, we have always lived and will always live in a state. There is not first a free individual who is then formed by a state. From the beginning, our freedom is formed by some kind of state—some kind of collective self-legislation—since we can make sense of who we are only in terms of socially instituted norms.

- The means required for a revolution depends on the historical situation, and Marx himself emphasizes that a revolution achieved through “peaceful means” of democracy is preferable to a violent one.54 In either event, the end—the purpose—of a revolution that emancipates us from capitalism must be the revaluation of value, which requires new institutional forms. Marx rightly calls for the overcoming of the state as a social form that maintains a capitalist division of classes. However, such a conception of the state is not its defining form (as Marx sometimes tends to assume). Rather, the state as an organ of competing class interests is a historically specific conception of the state, which can be overcome through the overcoming of capitalism. For life after capitalism to have any determinate form, we must reinvent rather than abolish the form of the state. As I have argued, the state as an institutional form of our lives—which can comprise a plurality of institutions—is not itself something that can be eliminated, since it is a condition for spiritual freedom to be possible.

    - mw:: Have to go back, because right now this reads as hand wavey as to why we do need a state.
- As Marx rightly underlines, “freedom consists in converting the state from an organ superimposed upon society into one completely subordinate to it.”56 To subordinate the state to society is to transform the state into an actual democracy. “All forms of states have democracy as their truth,” Marx writes, “and therefore they are untrue inasmuch as they are not democracies.”57 Emancipated forms of the state are thus required for what I call democratic socialism. Moreover, since capitalism is global, the overcoming of capitalism ultimately requires a global alliance of democratic socialist states. ([Location 4512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4512))
- Actual democracy requires that our political debates and deliberations—as well as our forms of political representation—are based on competing conceptions of how best to serve the interests of society as a whole, rather than on competing private interests that are put forth in the name of society as a whole. For the same reason, actual democracy requires that our society is organized in such a way that there does not have to be an antagonism between serving our own interests and serving the interests of society as a whole. While the commitment to serve the interests of society as a whole will always be challenging and contestable, it is in principle impossible to sustain such a commitment under capitalism. Because of the social form of wage labor, democratic politics and democratic states necessarily serve as organs for representing class interests that are competing for control. We cannot actually deliberate on how best to serve the interests of society as a whole, since we must prioritize the private interests of capitalists. This prioritization is not optional, since under capitalism there can be no production of social wealth without the profits of privately owned enterprises. ([Location 4518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4518))
- Nevertheless, it must be possible to specify the principles of democratic socialism, in light of which the specific questions of economic and political organization will have to be negotiated. Without such principles, the idea of democratic socialism is nothing but an abstract utopia with no actual claim on us. Moreover, the principles of democratic socialism cannot simply be posited but must be shown to be implicit in the Idea of freedom that is our historical achievement.

- From the beginning to the end of his work, Marx is guided by the commitment to freedom and equality, which come together in democracy. “Democracy is the solution to the riddle of every constitution,” Marx writes, since only in democracy do “we find the constitution founded on its true ground; real human beings and the real people…posited as the people’s own creation.”1 Through the institution of democracy, we can achieve the profound secular recognition that we are responsible for organizing and legislating the form of our life together.

- We are not subjected to the law (as in religion) but subjects of the law. “In democracy,” Marx emphasizes, “human being does not exist for the sake of the law, but the law exists for the sake of human being, it is human existence.”2 In a democracy, we are answerable not to God but to one another. ([Location 4551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4551))
- For Marx, however, civil rights are not sufficient for actual democracy. For political democracy to be actual—for us to actually be able to negotiate the form of our life together—the purpose and practice of our economy must itself be a matter of our democratic deliberation. This is why capitalism and actual democracy are incompatible. Under capitalism, the purpose of our economic production is already decided. What matters above all is to generate a “growth” of capital in the economy. This purpose is beyond democratic discussion, since it is built into how we measure our social wealth in the first place. We may discuss democratically how we should distribute our wealth, but how much wealth we have to distribute is determined by the growth of capital we are able to sustain in our economy. ([Location 4558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4558))
- Even when the necessary labor time in our society is reduced thanks to technological innovations, we cannot democratically decide which forms of labor should be available to pursue in our expanded realm of freedom. We cannot create new occupations on the basis of what would be important and meaningful to do for ourselves and for our society, but must find occupations that are profitable on the market, since only such occupations generate a growth of value in the economy. In effect, our social wealth under capitalism is not measured by actual productivity and surplus time. Rather, we are forced to measure our social wealth in terms of the surplus value we extract from the exploitation of living labor and transform into capital growth.

- As the pathbreaking Marx scholar Moishe Postone has shown, the problem with most forms of Marxism (and related left-wing political projects) is that their critiques are restricted to the capitalist mode of distribution and do not interrogate the measure of value that informs the mode of production itself. ([Location 4582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4582))
- Socialism is thereby reduced to a mode of political administration and economic distribution, which leaves the mode of production and the measure of value intact. This is exactly what happened in the Soviet Union, which managed to betray all of Marx’s fundamental insights. The Soviet legislation under Stalin literally changed the formulation of Marx’s core principle (“from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs”) to the following: “from each according to his ability, to each according to his labor.” It is hard to imagine a greater distortion of Marx’s thought. As soon as the satisfaction of our needs depends on the contribution of our labor, we are back to the form of coercion that Marx sought to overcome through his critique of wage labor. Under Stalinism, the state effectively becomes one giant capitalist that wields its power over the citizens by forcing them to do proletarian labor in order to survive.

- The problem with these regimes is not only that they failed to be politically democratic—a massive failure in its own right—but also that they failed to be socialist in their economic mode of production. Most forms of Marxism cannot grasp this point because they assume that the fundamental contradiction of capitalism resides between the mode of production and the mode of distribution. The wealth produced by proletarian labor is seen as potentially adequate to satisfy the needs of all members of society, and the critique of capitalism is restricted to a critique of the socioeconomic relations that prevent the wealth from being distributed in the right way.

- It is here instructive to consider the utopian vision of a socialist society proposed by the influential contemporary Marxist Fredric Jameson. In his book An American Utopia, Jameson claims to present a vision of life beyond capitalism, but he has no account of what capitalism is, since he never interrogates the measure of value as socially necessary labor time and never analyzes the contradiction in the capitalist mode of production, which is unavoidable as long as wage labor is the foundation of social wealth.

- The key to democratic socialism is to have institutions (including educational institutions and forms of political deliberation) that enable individuals to lead their lives in light of recognizing their dependence on others and on collective projects.

- Rather, the task of our democratic society is to be organized in such a way that we are intrinsically motivated to participate in, contribute to, and transform its ongoing life, by virtue of having been educated to exercise our spiritual freedom. The exercise of spiritual freedom must include the possibility of criticizing or rejecting the established forms of participation. ([Location 4625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4625))
- On the one hand, technology should not be seen as something that alienates us from a natural form of labor or a primitive communism. All such forms of nostalgia are misguided and ignore Marx’s fundamental insight that the commitment to social freedom for all became possible because of the historical advent of capitalism. There has never been a natural form of labor for spiritual beings and a primitive communism is neither possible nor desirable. The labor of spiritual beings is from the beginning a matter of technology (some form of tools), and the overcoming of capitalism requires the further development of technology rather than its rejection. On the other hand, capitalism cannot be overcome through a linear continuation of the same mode of production, accompanied merely by a redistribution of the wealth generated by proletarian labor. The aim is not to glorify proletarian labor but to overcome it. The overcoming of proletarian labor requires a transformation of the mode of production itself, which should be based on the power of dead labor rather than on the value of living labor. Technological advances entail that more and more of the production time that is required for our goods can be separated from the labor time of living beings. ([Location 4640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4640))
- Material forces of production cannot by themselves transform the measure of value that shapes our conception of social wealth. If our machines will be different it is not only because our technological abilities will be different, but because we will design the machines for a different purpose. A difference in purpose is a normative difference, which cannot be reduced to material conditions, since machines cannot by themselves determine the purpose of their production. The purpose of production is intelligible only in light of a measure of value that cannot be derived from the machines themselves. Thus, our normative purpose necessarily informs how we reproduce our material conditions. For example, under capitalism many of our technological devices are designed to break sooner rather than later, since it is more profitable for the producer if we are forced to buy a new device. Our technological know-how is not developed and employed in service of the practical purposes of our lives, but in service of maximizing profit. Under democratic socialism, by contrast, our research into new forms of technology, our designs of actual machines, and our actual process of production will all be different because we are producing for the sake of increasing socially available free time rather than for the sake of generating profit.

- The point of leading a free life—both individually and collectively—is not to transcend the realm of necessity but to be able to negotiate its relation to the realm of freedom. No matter how productive dead labor may become, it will always require at least the living labor of our planning the purposes and directing the operations of technology. Furthermore, the value of dead labor itself depends on our normative commitments. It is far from given that we will want to replace living labor with dead labor as much as possible and in all areas of necessary social labor. For example, even if we could design machines to take care of the sick and the elderly, we may hold that there is an intrinsic value in having care provided by other beings who care and who can understand suffering. The principle “from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs” is not the imposition of an anonymous collective will, but the condition of possibility for genuinely democratic deliberations regarding what matters to us and how we should care for one another.

- The revaluation of value is the most important aspect of the immanent critique of both capitalism and liberalism. For all their professed faith in our freedom, liberal thinkers have never been able to conceive that we can have a progressive, scientifically and technologically innovative society that is not based on the capitalist measure of social wealth. Yet, as we will see, the major liberal thinkers of political economy—Mill, Rawls, Keynes, and Hayek—unwittingly concede that the capitalist measure of wealth distorts the values to which they themselves are committed.

- The same contradiction can be traced in the work of John Maynard Keynes. While Keynes supports capitalism, he openly acknowledges that it is an economic system which leads us to elevate “some of the most distasteful of human qualities into the position of the highest virtues.”14 Indeed, Keynes dreams of the day when “we shall be able to afford to dare to assess the money-motive at its true value”: ([Location 4723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4723))
- Even though the capitalist way of life according to Keynes himself is a form of mental disease, which makes us participate in activities that are at least semi-criminal and semi-pathological, we have no choice but to obey for the time being, since only capitalism can deliver the goods that will set us free. “For at least another hundred years we must pretend to ourselves and to every one that fair is foul and foul is fair,” Keynes writes, “for foul is useful and fair is not. Avarice and usury and precaution must be our gods for a little longer still. For only they can lead us out of the tunnel of economic necessity into daylight” (emphasis added).16 ([Location 4735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4735))
- On the contrary, even though our material wealth is greater than ever before it is also more unevenly distributed than ever before and even those who possess astronomical amounts of capital wealth are still seeking to accumulate even more. This is not an accident but a dynamic that is intrinsic to capitalism. The accumulation of ever more capital wealth as an end in itself—with its necessary exploitation of living labor and its recurrent crises due to overproduction—is not a temporary phase of capitalism but its operating principle. ([Location 4742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4742))
- A continuously increasing collective liberation from the realm of economic necessity is only possible if we measure our social wealth in terms of our actual capacity to produce the goods that we need and our actual capacity to reduce the socially necessary labor time.

([Location 4750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4750))
- This is why we can have housing crises and homeless families even when we have produced millions of vacant apartments, which are left empty because they cannot be sold for profit. Likewise, under capitalism we do not reduce the socially necessary labor time in order to increase the socially available free time, but in order to extract more relative surplus value from living labor. This is why the reduction of socially necessary labor time under capitalism does not lead to solutions regarding economic poverty but generates the problem of unemployment. ([Location 4753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4753))
- A surplus population of the unemployed is essential to the extraction of relative surplus value, for at least three reasons. First, the reduction of socially necessary labor time through technological innovation necessarily leads to unemployment, since fewer workers are required in the process of production. Second, the unemployed have to accept less pay to find a temporary job and thereby allow capitalists to keep down the general level of wages. Third, the surplus population of the unemployed is highly useful for the irregular rhythms of capitalist production, since the unemployed are available for employment when an increase of production is profitable and can be dispensed with when production needs to be decreased for the sake of capital gain. ([Location 4762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4762))
- The dynamic of capitalism, then, is not oriented toward solving the problem of unemployment, but actively benefits from the existence of unemployment. Moreover, under capitalism we cannot transform the negative value of unemployment into the positive value of free time to lead our lives, since our measure of value is labor time. Keynes’s claim—that we must endure capitalism because eventually it will set us free—is untenable. ([Location 4768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4768))
- Social democracy in my sense is not limited to welfare state politics and my notion of democratic socialism is not reducible to any previous visions of socialism. Rather, my analytical definitions are the following. What I call social democracy comprises any form of socialism or Marxism that limits itself to redistribution and does not grapple with the fundamental question of value in the mode of production. Democratic socialism, by contrast, requires a fundamental and practical revaluation of the capitalist measure of value. ([Location 4786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4786))
- During the twentieth century, social democracy developed into a “soft” form of capitalism, whose crowning achievement was the welfare state. I myself grew up in one of the most successful welfare states (Sweden), which converted the massive economic growth after 1945 into a distribution of wealth across society. While my grandparents were poor peasants in northern Sweden, my parents could ascend to stable middle-class lives thanks to free public education and a booming economy. When I grew up, everyone in Sweden received free health care and free childcare, and all education including university was free. It was the pinnacle of a development that started in the nineteenth century, when workers began to organize politically and gradually improved everything from labor conditions to voting rights and public services. Social democracy, however, restricts itself to transforming the mode of distribution and remains dependent on the capitalist mode of production. ([Location 4790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4790))
- As a consequence, the fate of the welfare state is bound to the fate of the capitalist economy. During a few decades after World War II, it could seem as if social democracy had found a way to tame capitalism and put it to work for the common good. Yet the crisis in the world economy in the 1970s—and the slow compound growth ever since—clearly recalls that capitalism is in control of the welfare state and not the other way around. ([Location 4797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4797))
- The welfare state depends on capitalism (since the social democratic welfare system literally lives off the wealth generated by wage labor), but capitalism does not depend on the welfare state. Thus, with less wealth to distribute across society because of economic crises, the neoliberal strategies to generate more compound growth—deregulation of the job market, privatization of public services, and so on—won political assent. ([Location 4800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4800))
- A universal basic income can thus have emancipatory effects. Yet it is seriously misleading to describe UBI—as Calnitsky and many others do—as a potential solution to the problem of wage labor that Marx analyzed. ([Location 4828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4828))
- Calnitsky fails to grasp, however, that a UBI cannot even in principle overcome the dependence on wage labor. On the contrary, any form of universal basic income is altogether dependent on the social form of wage labor, since any form of UBI consists in a redistribution of the capital wealth that is generated by wage labor. Under capitalism, wage labor in the service of profit is the necessary source of social wealth. This dependence on wage labor is perpetuated rather than overcome by a UBI. ([Location 4833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4833))
- question of how wealth is produced under capitalism. Advocates of a universal basic income (or other forms of redistributive justice) never question the measure and production of value under capitalism but focus only on the distribution of wealth across society. For the same reason, they cannot grasp the contradiction in which any progressive reform of capitalism will be caught, whether it seeks to strengthen the welfare state, provide a universal basic income, or combine the two. ([Location 4841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4841))
- Economic crises cannot be avoided either through regulations of the market (social democracy) or deregulations of the market (neoliberalism), since the tendency toward crises is inherent in the capitalist mode of production itself. ([Location 4888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4888))
- If the proportion of nonliving production time is allowed to increase indefinitely, the proportion of living labor time will decrease indefinitely and the possibility of making a profit will diminish. When I have perfected my hyper-well to such a degree that it barely requires any living labor time to operate, I am left with almost nothing from which I can extract surplus value in order to make a profit. ([Location 4925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4925))
- It is because the rate of profit tends to fall that capitalist employers must intensify the exploitation of living labor and/or export the production facilities to locations where labor is cheaper to buy. ([Location 4930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4930))
- Unemployment and the exportation of jobs are not something that can be removed under capitalism, but a necessary condition for the production of capital wealth. Lowering the relative value of wages and sustaining a rate of profit depends on a surplus population of the unemployed who are willing to work for less, either domestically or in poorer countries to which production is moved. ([Location 4933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4933))
- Hence, it is a grave mistake to think that the tendency toward crises heralds the end of capitalism. Crises are essential to cycles of capitalist accumulation and necessary for the continued production of capital wealth. For the rate of profit to rise again, the ratio of living labor time must increase relative to nonliving production time, which requires the devaluation or destruction of productive capital. ([Location 4944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4944))
- Nevertheless, many avowed Marxists continue to hinge their critique of capitalism on the prediction of a “terminal crisis.” Such a critique of capitalism is deeply misguided. The problem with capitalism is not that it will collapse, but that it can sustain itself only through a self-contradictory dynamic that has pernicious social consequences. Given the capitalist measure of social wealth, the free time we gain thanks to technological efficiency cannot be recognized as a value in itself. Increased technological productivity could give everyone more free time to lead their lives, if we pursued technological innovation for the sake of emancipation rather than for the sake of profit. ([Location 4949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4949))
- Questions of economic organization, however, are not reducible to the means with which we pursue our ends. Rather, how we organize the economy of our lives is itself an expression of how we posit the relation between means and ends. Economical questions are at the heart of any form of spiritual life, since they concern our order of priorities. How we organize the economy of our lives is ultimately a matter of how we understand the value of different activities and what we take to be worth doing with our time. Our economical self-organization shapes not only our means but also our ends. ([Location 4986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4986))

- The crucial question for any form of economic planning is the relation between part and whole. ([Location 4999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4999))
- For Hayek, the ideal relation between part and whole is achieved by “the spontaneously formed order of the market,”46 which gives rise to a “more efficient allocation of resources than any design could achieve.”47 ([Location 5015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5015))
- The problem with ==Hayek’s== analysis, however, is that he never asks himself how value is produced in a capitalist market economy. Like other liberal thinkers, **he treats the capitalist market economy as the optimal instrument for the distribution of wealth, rather than as a unique social form for the production of wealth**. ([Location 5018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5018))
- As a capitalist, I do not price my commodities in an attempt to “communicate” how efficiently I actually can produce the commodity in question. If it is more profitable to restrain my production capacities and create an artificial scarcity, I will do that instead. Likewise, as a capitalist, I am not trying to obtain the right kind of “information” about the actual needs of the population, so that my supply can meet the relevant demands. My aim is rather to manipulate both supply and demand for the sake of maximal gain, regardless of the social consequences. ([Location 5035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5035))
- The manipulation of supply and demand for the sake of profit is not a moral failure of individual capitalists, but an effect of the principle of production to which we are collectively committed in sustaining capitalism. ([Location 5039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5039))
- Far from safeguarding our economic freedom, capitalism deprives us of the ability to decide our economic priorities and democratically deliberate on the form of our economic life. The priority of our economy is already determined for us—to labor for the sake of profit—since it is built into the capitalist definition of social wealth. ([Location 5055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5055))
- Hayek cannot see the problem in question, since he reduces freedom to liberty.56 As long as we are not directly coerced to act in one way rather than another—i.e., as long as we have formal liberty—we are free in the relevant sense for Hayek. For the same reason, Hayek in effect reduces decision to choice. As long as we can make a choice without anyone forcing us or telling us what to do, we are free. ([Location 5057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5057))
- Such a formal conception of freedom, however, is utterly impoverished. To lead a free life it is not sufficient that we are exempt from direct coercion and allowed to make choices. To lead a free life we must be able to recognize ourselves in what we do, to see our practical activities as expressions of our own commitments. This requires that we are able to engage not only in choices but also in fundamental decisions regarding the purposes that determine our range of choices and for the sake of which we lead our lives. ([Location 5061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5061))
- Under capitalism we are all in practice committed to a purpose in which we cannot recognize ourselves, which inevitably leads to alienated forms of social life. The actual needs and abilities we have are secondary; what matters first of all is whether capitalists can profit from our needs and exploit our abilities in wage labor. The market decides which abilities we should harness, while our needs are transformed in view of what we can buy. Many of the abilities that we could develop—if we had the time to lead our lives—are discarded because they are not deemed to be profitable, and many needs are engineered to make us purchase more commodities rather than to provide satisfaction. ([Location 5069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5069))
- We should be the subjects of what we do and what we value, rather than being subjected to what we supposedly need to do and what we supposedly value. How such a revolution of our lives is possible—and what it requires of us—is specified by the principles of democratic socialism that I will articulate. ([Location 5078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5078))
- The general and concrete principles of democratic socialism cannot be posited as an ideal that is external to our historical form of life, since in that case they would have no claim on us. The principles must be internally derived from the Idea of freedom through which we already seek to justify liberal democracy and capitalism. As I have emphasized throughout, the critique of liberalism and capitalism must be an immanent critique, which locates the resources for emancipation within the commitments we already avow. ([Location 5087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5087))
The first principle of democratic socialism is that we measure our wealth—both individual and collective—in terms of socially available free time. Our free time depends on social and institutional forms because it does not concern a mere quantity of time. Rather, our quantity of free time is inseparable from the quality of our free time, which requires institutions that allow us to shape, cultivate, and transform the commitments in light of which we lead our lives. For the same reason, free time is not necessarily leisure time but any time we devote to activities that for us count as ends in themselves. For example, the time I devote to writing this book counts as free time, since having time to think through and articulate fundamental philosophical ideas is an end in itself for me. ([Location 5095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5095)) ^77vt5v

- To pursue philosophical ideas and write books is not something I can do on my own, however, since the activity requires institutional forms that render intelligible what I am doing (both to myself and to others). ([Location 5101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5101))
- Our social institutions are not necessarily explicit but always implicit in what we do and in all forms of practical identities (e.g., being a philosopher or being a parent). All the activities we regard as essential parts of a practical identity—as essential parts of a vocation with which we identify—belong to the realm of freedom, and the time we devote to them counts as free time. ([Location 5103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5103))
- All practical identities (e.g., parent, philosopher, political activist) are social roles, but not all social roles we take on count as practical identities for us. Only the social roles with which we identify as ends in themselves are practical identities for us, whereas other social roles merely serve as means to an end. To be clear, even a mere social role has normative criteria that we can seek to fulfill or transform in light of an end to which we are committed, as when we participate in sanitation work for the sake of the common good. ([Location 5110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5110))
- To reduce the realm of necessity, we must therefore decrease the quantity and improve the quality of our socially necessary labor time (the time required to meet our needs). ([Location 5121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5121))
- In light of the first principle of democratic socialism—the measure of our wealth in terms of socially available free time—we are committed to reducing our socially necessary labor time through technological innovation. For example, the living labor time required for street cleaning can be dramatically reduced by a machine that only requires the push of a button to operate.

    - mw:: Seems likrrethetr is a jumo heere. Feel like technologhy is ner that "clean", no pun intended
- The second principle of democratic socialism is that the means of production are collectively owned and cannot be used for the sake of profit. The second principle is entailed by the first, since collective ownership of the means of production is the material condition of possibility for recognizing socially available free time as the measure of our wealth. ([Location 5137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5137))
- Because we own the means of production collectively, we can engineer technologies with the aim of generating as much surplus time as possible for everyone. ([Location 5143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5143))
- Collective ownership of the means of production does not mean that we are prevented from having private property in a concrete sense. We can have our own houses, our own computers, our own books, and so on, in the sense that we can use them for our own ends and no one has the right to take them away from us against our will. While we can have private property in a concrete sense, however, we cannot have private property in the abstract sense that transforms property into a commodity that can be bought and sold for profit. The recognition of your property as your property is not based on your right to its abstract value as a commodity (or as a means for producing commodities), but on your right to its concrete specificity as valuable to you and as useful for you in leading your life. ([Location 5148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5148))

- An instructive example is Internet service. Under democratic socialism, everyone would have Internet access at the maximal speed enabled by our currently available technology, with a collective commitment to create technology that makes Internet access even faster and possible to maintain with even less socially necessary labor. While our democratic state provides the Internet service, the actual use and applications of the Internet are not restricted by the dictates of a central planning committee. Rather, we have both the material resources and the socially available free time to develop applications that resolve problems which emerge in “the particular circumstances of time and place”—to recall Hayek’s language—allowing for “the utilization of knowledge which is not given to anyone in its totality” and drawing on “unique information of which beneficial use might be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to [the individual] or are made with his active cooperation.” ([Location 5156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5156))
- In a capitalist free market, by contrast, Internet service will always be provided by regional monopolies that operate for profit. Contrary to what Hayek assumes, monopolies tend to form naturally in a free market, since private ownership of the required technological infrastructure makes it harder and harder to compete with the company that has built the dominant network. Given the profit motive, a company has no inherent interest in offering us general Internet access at the maximal speed possible. Slower and partial access will be preferred if that is more profitable. ([Location 5168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5168))
- Only by removing the profit motive can we have a reciprocal determination of our evolving resources (the whole) and our evolving demands (the part). ([Location 5175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5175))
- Hence, the third principle of democratic socialism is the one formulated by Marx: “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.”57 Marx does not develop the meaning of the principle, but in light of the first two principles of democratic socialism we can elaborate the implications. The aim of democratic socialism is to allow us not only to live our lives by satisfying our needs but also to lead our lives by cultivating our abilities. We are collectively committed to producing the necessary means of subsistence, as well as the means and institutions for each one to pursue the activities that matter to him or her (painting, writing, music, athletics, theater, and so on). ([Location 5190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5190))
- The key feature here is that democratic socialism enables us to live our lives in the realm of necessity in light of the way we lead our lives in the realm of freedom. The realm of necessity and the realm of freedom cannot be separated, but everything hinges on distinguishing between them in the right way. ([Location 5197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5197))
- society. The idea, however, is that we will be intrinsically motivated to participate in social labor when we can recognize that the social production is for the sake of the common good and our own freedom to lead a life. Capitalist wage labor is inherently alienating, since we are not part of deciding the purpose of what we are producing and our work is conceived for the sake of a profit that is posited as an end in itself rather than as a means to our freedom. ([Location 5205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5205))
- Even tedious work we do in the realm of necessity—e.g., participating in the garbage removal in our neighborhood on a weekly basis—can be seen in light of the realm of freedom, since the work is geared toward reducing socially necessary labor time and increasing socially available free time. Unlike under capitalism, we can make sense of why we are doing what we are doing, through education and democratic deliberation regarding the form of life we are sustaining. ([Location 5210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5210))
- Those who object that we will not be motivated to work unless we have to secure our survival—or have the chance to make a monetary profit—should consider their lack of faith in our spiritual freedom. Their argument assumes that we need to be commanded by a single ought of survival or profit in order to work and cannot be allowed to engage the double ought of our spiritual freedom. A single ought of survival or profit alienates us from our spiritual freedom, since it commands us to work on the basis of a perceived necessity rather than in light of a responsibility to which we have bound ourselves. Only if we are granted the material, social, and institutional resources to exercise our spiritual freedom can we actually identify with what we are doing as our own activity. ([Location 5213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5213))
- Under democratic socialism, we have three ways of reducing and qualitatively transforming socially necessary labor time. ([Location 5232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5232))
- First, large parts of our socially necessary labor can be done in the realm of freedom, insofar as it is performed by persons who are committed to the occupation as an end in itself and thus take up the required social role as a practical identity in light of which they lead their lives. For example, architecture is a socially necessary form of labor, since we cannot live our lives without inhabiting spaces that are conducive to our activities. Yet if the work of planning buildings is valuable in itself for the architect, the time she devotes to architecture does not count as a negative cost of socially necessary labor time but as a positive access to socially available free time. Her socially necessary labor as an architect is being done in the realm of freedom rather than in the realm of necessity. ([Location 5233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5233))
- Second, the socially necessary labor that no one wants to do for its own sake (that everyone counts as a negative cost of necessary labor time) is not being done as alienated labor by persons who need money to survive and cannot identify with the social purpose of what they are doing. Rather, the socially necessary labor time is qualitatively transformed in being shared by members of society on the basis of their abilities and commitments, with the explicit purpose of contributing to a common good that everyone can recognize as devoted to improving their own possibilities of leading a free life. ([Location 5238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5238))
- Third, through technological development and innovative solutions, we are collectively committed to reducing the labor time that is socially necessary to maintain our lives and increasing the free time that is socially available to lead our lives. Reducing socially necessary labor time does not necessarily mean that we spend less time on socially necessary labor, but that the time we spend on such labor is to a greater degree a matter of socially available free time. ([Location 5246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5246))
- The project of reducing socially necessary labor time, however, should not be conflated with an aspiration to eliminate socially necessary labor time. It is neither possible nor desirable to eliminate socially necessary labor time altogether. Our lives will always require some form of maintenance and the question of how to maintain our material lives is an intrinsic part of our spiritual freedom. Eliminating socially necessary labor time is not even an intelligible goal for a free life, since the question of where to draw the distinction between necessity and freedom must itself remain a living question for anyone who leads a free life. ([Location 5268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5268))
- The question of what you should do with your life—the question of your existential identity—is recognized as an irreducible question, which must be allowed to remain explicitly at issue in any vital spiritual life. ([Location 5293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5293))
- The fundamental questions of economy—the questions of what we prioritize, what we value, what is worth doing with our time—are thus recognized as being at the heart of our spiritual lives. ([Location 5295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5295))
- The aim of democratic socialism is not to answer our economic questions once and for all, but to enable us to “own” the questions as the most important questions of our shared lives. ([Location 5297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5297))
- An illuminating example is the production and consumption of artworks. Under capitalism, “owning” a work of art means having the abstract property right to a work of art rather than having the concrete ability to appreciate and understand the object in question. Under capitalism, we can be “owners” of artworks while having a merely abstract relation to the objects in question. We can hang a Cézanne on our wall as a token of social prestige without having either the time to appreciate it or the education to grasp its significance. Furthermore, artists under capitalism have the abstract property right to their works of art, but concretely they have to sell their artworks for profit in order to make a living. Under democratic socialism, by contrast, artworks cannot be commodities that are bought and sold for profit, but artists have the concrete property right to their work—in the sense that no one can take it away from them against their will—by virtue of having created it. ([Location 5388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5388))
- As Marx emphasizes, our senses are themselves formed by the kinds of labor we do and the conditions under which we live. If you are worn out after a day of alienated labor, your ability to engage with other aspects of your life will itself be diminished and your free time will become a means to restore your labor-power rather than the form in which you lead your life. Actual free labor, by contrast, requires the socially available free time that allows you to own the question of what to do with your life. ([Location 5405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5405))
- Which occupations you can take up as your official professions and what you can do in your spare time will depend on your concrete abilities. For example, under democratic socialism everyone has access to free education and can apply to medical school, but which of us will actually become doctors is a matter of how able we turn out to ([Location 5409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5409))
- As Marx points out in a brilliant passage, when you cannot buy love, art, and influence over other people for money, then being a lover, an art connoisseur, or an influential person will depend on who you actually are, rather than on the purchasing power you have: ([Location 5414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5414))
- Democratic socialism therefore requires that we develop practices which allow us to grasp explicitly that our material and spiritual lives are two sides of the same coin. If the time we spend in the realm of necessity—e.g., doing some form of labor that is necessary to sustain our life together—can be seen as socially shared and as contributing to the expansion of our collective realm of freedom, then even tedious forms of labor become expressive of our commitment to lead a free life. ([Location 5447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5447))
- Contrary to what many influential philosophers have claimed (from Hannah Arendt to Michel Henry),70 freedom for Marx does not consist in a liberation from labor and necessity. Overcoming capitalism will not lead us to a state of “overabundance” in which all our needs are automatically fulfilled and we do not have to make any effort to sustain our material lives. Such a state of overabundance is not only impossible to attain but also undesirable, since there cannot be a realm of freedom that is not bound to a realm of necessity. If ([Location 5460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5460))
- The overcoming of capitalism, then, should in no way be conflated with the overcoming of finitude. Yet this is precisely the mistake made by Adorno and many other utopian Marxists. “I believe,” Adorno maintains, “that without the notion of an unfettered life, freed from death, the idea of utopia, the idea of the utopia, cannot even be thought at ([Location 5481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5481))
- Adorno does not grasp that the relation to the negative—suffering, boredom, and death—is intrinsic to the positive possibility of freedom. Suffering, boredom, and anxiety before death are not reducible to psychological states—or historically specific pathologies—but rather necessary conditions for leading a free life. The relation to suffering, boredom, and death renders intelligible how leading our lives can matter to us in the first place. If nothing could count as suffering for us, we would never have a reason to object to anything that happens to us and no reason to change or improve our condition. ([Location 5529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5529))
- On the one hand, there are historically and socially specific forms of suffering that we should seek to overcome. We do not have to suffer from the injustices of capitalism, we do not have to be subjected to the opposition between worktime and leisure time that makes a certain form of boredom pervasive, and we do not have to die from many of the causes that currently wreck our lives. We can and should do better. On the other hand, if we conflate historically or socially specific forms of suffering, boredom, and death with the existential categories of suffering, boredom, and death per se, we deprive ourselves of the ability to identify the actual forms of suffering that we are committed to overcoming. Instead of engaging the problem of how to identify and transform the pernicious ways in which we are leading our finite lives, the problem is conflated with the fact that we are leading a finite life at all. We are thus led to the dead end of religious despair over finite life itself and saddled with the religious longing for a redemption from the condition of finitude. ([Location 5557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5557))
- Yet the religious understanding of finitude makes us misrecognize the suffering we seek to overcome. What we are missing is not eternal life but social and institutional forms of being together that enable us to lead flourishing lives.

- The critique of religion—like the critique of capitalism—must therefore be an immanent critique. We must locate the resources for overcoming the religious understanding of finitude within the practice of faith and its commitment to a shared social life. The practice of religious faith has often served—and still serves for many—as an important communal expression of solidarity. Likewise, religious organizations often provide services for those who are poor and in need. Most importantly, religious discourses have often been mobilized in concrete struggles against injustice. None of these social commitments, however, requires religious faith or a religious form of organization. For these commitments to fulfill their promise of emancipation, religious faith must be converted into secular faith and be devoted to social justice as an end in itself. If we are committed to abolishing poverty rather than promising salvation for the poor, the faith we embody in practice is secular rather than religious, since we acknowledge our life together as our ultimate purpose. This argument—which brings together secular faith and spiritual freedom in the pursuit of actual emancipation—leads us to the concluding movement of this book.

- The liberal establishment—which supported King when he focused on acquiring formal civil rights for African Americans—became increasingly antagonistic to King as he turned his attention to the systematic forms of economic injustice underpinning and informing the racial forms of injustice.

- FBI director J. Edgar Hoover (who had been wiretapping King since 1961) created a new “racial intelligence” section, with a mission to “publicize King as a traitor to his country and race.” ([Location 5653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5653))
- At the same time, both the New Left and the emerging Black Power movement tended to dismiss King as outdated. Especially in the wake of the riots that began in the mid-sixties, King’s nonviolent methods and his coalition politics were derided as inadequate to the demands of the time. While the establishment regarded King as too radical, the avant-garde regarded him as not radical enough and criticized him for being essentially a middle-class preacher who pursued middle-class goals.

- ==The maintenance of dual labor markets (black and white) is economically irrational under capitalism, since it creates an artificial barrier to labor recruitment and prevents each unit from being treated as abstractly equivalent for the sake of efficiency==. A simple but illuminating example (which I borrow from [[Adolph Reed]], Jr.) is the economic wastefulness of having to maintain two different sets of toilets—for blacks and whites respectively—in the plants.6 More generally, the violent instability of the segregationist South was itself inefficient and an obstacle that needed to be removed for capitalist enterprise to expand. ([Location 5674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5674))
- As King made clear, nonviolent action is not passive and submissive but militant and coercive. “Nonviolence must be adapted to urban conditions and urban moods,” King avowed. “We must fashion the new tactics which do not count on government goodwill, but instead serve to compel unwilling authorities to yield to the mandates of justice.” ([Location 5698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5698))
- To this end, King argued that “militant non-violence” was not only morally but also pragmatically and politically superior to violent riots. “To dislocate the functioning of a city without destroying it can be more effective than a riot because it can be longer-lasting, costly to the larger society, but not wantonly destructive.”11 King rightly predicted that riots would only strengthen the right-wing demonization of the black population and facilitate repressive measures on the part of the governing authorities. By contrast, politically articulated forms of mass civil disobedience—which highlight actual forms of racial and economic inequality—exhibit moral authority in practice and are “more difficult for the government to quell by superior force.” ([Location 5702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5702))

- King was well aware of the opposition he would meet from those in power, but it did not prevent him from radicalizing his public stance. “Something is wrong with the economic system of our nation,” King emphasized more and more often in the last years of his life. “Something is wrong with capitalism.”17 These were not abstract claims but directly linked to the concrete problems regarding housing, education, and welfare that he encountered while working in the ghettos of the North, as well as with the urban and rural poor in the South. “For years I labored with the idea of reforming the existing institutions of the society, a little change here, a little change there,” King said in an interview in 1967. “Now I feel quite differently, I think you’ve got to have a reconstruction of the entire society, a revolution of values.” ([Location 5730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5730))
- King had studied Marx already in his early twenties and throughout his life he expressed his appreciation of Marx’s economic analysis of systemic injustice. “We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars in life’s market place,” King reminded his audience at the convention, “but one day we must come to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring….When you deal with this, you begin to ask the question: ‘Who owns the oil?’ You begin to ask the question: ‘Who owns the iron ore?’ ([Location 5744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5744))

- “It was something like keeping a man in prison for many, many years,” King points out, “and suddenly discovering that he is not guilty of the crime for which he was imprisoned. And then you just go up to him and say, ‘Now, you’re free.’ But you don’t give him any bus fare to get to town. You don’t give him any money to get some clothes to put on his back. You don’t give him anything to get started in life again….We were left illiterate, penniless, just told, ‘you’re free.’ ”31 In the same period of U.S. history, King recalls, Congress was giving away millions of acres of land to white peasants from Europe, for whom the state “built land-grant colleges to teach them how to farm, provided county agents to further expertise in farming, and then later provided low interest rates so that they could mechanize their farms.” ([Location 5788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5788))

- As King was well aware, however, such a solution can never address the root of the problem, which is fundamentally economic. A society that seeks to promote true equality of opportunity cannot limit itself to having a few representatives of an ethnically defined group in positions of power, while the mechanisms of economic marginalization continue to be operative for the majority. Rather, facilitating true equality of opportunity requires that every citizen have adequate resources for material well-being, education, and social recognition. ([Location 5808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5808))
- In his speeches and books, King keeps returning to automation as a double-edged phenomenon. The automation of previously necessary labor should be emancipatory, since it liberates us from the need to expend our lifetime on tedious forms of work. Yet, under capitalism, automation does not lead to the emancipation of workers but rather to their unemployment, which makes them available for further exploitation in temporary jobs and with lower wages. “As machines replace men, we must again question whether the depth of our social thinking matches the growth of our technological creativity,” King emphasizes in a speech to the Workers Union of America in 1962.36 “We cannot create machines which revolutionize industry unless we simultaneously create ideas commensurate with social and economic reorganization, which harness the power of such machines for the benefit of man. The new age will not be an era of hope but of fear and emptiness unless we master this problem.” ([Location 5819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5819))
- The reformation of capitalism through the redistribution of wealth can never achieve such a transformation of society, since the wealth to be distributed is produced by the social relations of capitalist exploitation and commodification. The more we restrict exploitation and commodification, the less wealth we have to distribute. This practical contradiction in any progressive attempt to redistribute wealth is unavoidable as long as we live under capitalism. If we are to understand the concrete challenges that will face all redistributive reforms, we need to recognize the practical contradiction and take it into account in pursuing our political strategies as well as in articulating our priorities.

- As Rosa Luxemburg argued at the beginning of the twentieth century, “the daily struggle for reforms, for the amelioration of the condition of the workers within the framework of the existing social order, and for democratic institutions”38—such reform work is absolutely indispensable.

- The two forms of consciousness that Marx identifies as the main subjects of critique are religious and political. Our religious and political self-understanding are the main subjects of critique for Marx—as they are for me in the chapters of This Life—since religion and politics are the dominant forms in which we express our understanding of what we struggle for, what we are dreaming of, and what we desire. To transform our understanding of our struggles, our dreams, and our desires, we must therefore transform the practice of religion and politics. ([Location 5921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5921))
- Already as an undergraduate at Crozer Theological Seminary, King had read Hegel, and while pursuing his doctorate at Boston University he studied Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit as well as his Philosophy of History and Philosophy of Right. Indeed, the philosophical discussion group that King hosted in his Boston apartment was called “the dialectical society,” named after the dialectical method of philosophy that Hegel articulated and that Marx sought to develop in his own way. ([Location 5960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5960))
- Hegel lived in Europe during a historical period (1770–1831) characterized by great political revolutions and profound transformations in the understanding of what it means to be free, stretching from the American Revolution in the 1770s to the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution and economic globalization in the first decades of the 1800s. For Hegel, the two most important events were the publication of Immanuel Kant’s revolutionary philosophical trilogy—Critique of Pure Reason (1781), Critique of Practical Reason (1788), Critique of Judgment (1790)—and the French Revolution that began in 1789. Both of these events disclosed the stakes of a modern, secular conception of freedom that Hegel pursued throughout his philosophical trajectory. 59 ([Location 5965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5965))
- Kant’s revolutionary move is to argue that the question of authority cannot be settled by appeals to religion, tradition, or the given laws of the state. For a given law to be binding, we must hold ourselves to be bound by it. A given law cannot have authority automatically and by itself—it must be taken as authoritative by us to have authority over us. For the same reason, a given law can lose its hold over us or be called into question by us, which was dramatically demonstrated by the French Revolution and more generally by the transition from monarchy to democracy. ([Location 5972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5972))
- Such dramatic transformations illuminate that we are always acting “under the idea of freedom,” as Kant famously puts it. ([Location 5976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5976))
- The form of self-consciousness is therefore the condition for being beholden to others, as well as for the possibility of self-correction and self-transformation. ([Location 6005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6005))
- We do not merely have a sense of what we ought to do (a given norm); we also have the capacity to ask ourselves if we ought to do what we supposedly ought to do. This double ought structure is at the heart of what I have called our spiritual freedom. In Hegel’s terms, we are not simply conscious of what we do but self-conscious of being answerable for what we do and thereby capable of questioning the principles of our practices. ([Location 6046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6046))
- For Hegel, the important task is to build institutional practices that acknowledge and enable us to cultivate our spiritual freedom. The problem with religious forms of faith, then, is that they ultimately disown our spiritual freedom. In order to engage the question of who we should be and what we should do, we must recognize that we ourselves produce the communal norms that we seek to defend, critique, or transform. ([Location 6050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6050))
- In Hegel’s account, the self-understanding of religious believers is therefore at odds with their own practical activity. The actual object of devotion in the practice of faith is the community itself. The Christian Trinity is not an independently existing reality but a pictorial representation of the structure of the community of believers. “God” is a name for the self-legislated communal norms (the principles to which the congregation holds itself); “Christ” is a name for the social actors who sustain the norms through their embodied practices; and “the Holy Spirit” is a name for the institutional relations of the Church through which the norms are actualized. By going to church and worshipping together, the members of the congregation bring into being a form of spiritual life: they hold one another responsible, treat one another as committed, and acknowledge one another’s personal dignity. ([Location 6055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6055))
- Such mutual dependence is at the heart of any form of spiritual life, which must be developed and sustained through social practices of recognition that are materially embodied. The religious community, however, does not understand its own activity to be an end in itself. Rather, the individual members take the religious community to be a means for the end of serving an independently existing God and earning a salvation that transcends the fragility of the shared congregational life. ([Location 6061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6061))
- Hegel’s understanding of faith is secular in my sense of the term. He seeks to make us recognize that the object of our faith is inseparable from the practice of faith. ([Location 6067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6067))
- The life-defining norms to which we hold ourselves (God) can exist only by being embodied in our practices as individual social actors (Christ), who can live on and be recognized for who we are only through the institutional relations that we share (the Holy Spirit). The tripartite structure is the key to Hegel’s secular reading of the birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus. ([Location 6078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6078))
- Accordingly, Hegel argues that the defining feature of spiritual life is the burial of the dead. By commemorating an individual through the act of burial, we recognize in practice that material and spiritual life are inseparable but distinguishable. ([Location 6086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6086))
- The prospect of our own death is a matter of what Hegel calls “absolute fear.”68 The fear of our own death is “absolute” because it is not fear of a specific object or subject but fear of losing the very ability to experience any objects or subjects—the fear of losing our own subjectivity. ([Location 6124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6124))
- To determine anything as true, good, and just requires a practical commitment that binds us to suffer from and revolt against what we count as false, evil, and unjust. Yet the supposed wisdom of the Stoic is to withdraw from such commitments, since they make him liable to agonize over the state of the world and leave him vulnerable to contestation. ([Location 6178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6178))
- The Idea of a form of life is therefore the condition of intelligibility for both any form of fidelity and any form of betrayal. ([Location 6254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6254))
- For the same reason, the Idea of who we ought to be is itself something that can be challenged and transformed. Because any Idea—whether of an individual or a collective—must be embodied in practice, the Idea of who we ought to be can always be taken up in a different way, called into question, and be the subject of a revolution. This is the radical implication of Hegel’s notion of Entäusserung. ([Location 6261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6261))
- A secular reconciliation, by contrast, recognizes that “there is nothing degrading about being alive” (as Hegel puts it in a poignant phrase).77 Being vulnerable to pain, loss, and death is not a fallen condition but inseparable from being someone for whom something can matter. ([Location 6274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6274))
- Far from advocating such invulnerability, a secular reconciliation with finitude acknowledges that we must be vulnerable—we must be marked by the suffering of pain, the mourning of loss, the anxiety before death—in order to lead our lives and care about one another. Only through such an acknowledgment can we turn away from the religious promise of absolution and turn toward our time together. Only through such an acknowledgment can we understand the urgency of changing our lives. We are reconciled with being alive, but for that very reason we are not reconciled to living unworthy lives. We demand a better society and we know that it depends on us. In taking action, we are not waiting for a timeless future but grasp in practice that our time is all we have.

- the most famous of the hymns: “We Shall Overcome.” The latter hymn has become so iconic that its powerful resonance tends to be lost for us today, but it is crucial to hear the resolute expression of secular faith at its core. What we believe deep in our hearts—the hymn avows—is not that God will save us but that we shall overcome our subordination through collective action. ([Location 6317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6317))
- The mass meetings in the Mason Temple—and the two speeches that King gave there—can be seen as profound manifestations of secular faith. To engage their implications, we must here make explicit the final aspect of secular faith. The object of secular faith is always a spiritual cause, which moves us to act and determines what is important to us.81 Spiritual causes are those for the sake of which we lead our lives and try to respond to the demands of our practical identities. ([Location 6327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6327))
- Moreover, there is no neutral standpoint from which we are free to choose our spiritual causes. Before we can decide anything, we are already constrained by the spiritual causes we inherit from the social world into which we are born. Nevertheless, we are responsible for sustaining, contesting, or changing the spiritual causes that determine the stakes of our actions. For there to be demands of parenthood, artistic vocations, and political causes, we must hold ourselves to those demands and thereby believe that they matter. ([Location 6339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6339))
- When we own our secular faith, we acknowledge that the object of our faith—our spiritual cause—is dependent on our practice of faith. The practice of faith is our practical identity (e.g., political activist) and the object of faith is our spiritual cause (e.g., our political cause). ([Location 6343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6343))
- When King says that “God” has commanded us to help the poor to emancipate themselves—and that he is doing “God’s will” in pursuing social freedom as an end in itself—King cannot be referring to the religious notion of an eternal God, since by his own admission he cannot determine the will of such a God. The command or the will of God only makes sense if we understand the term in a Hegelian way. “God” is a name for the communal norms that we have legislated to ourselves and to which we hold ourselves. ([Location 6374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6374))
- What ultimately matters from a religious perspective is not freedom but salvation; what ultimately matters is not to lead a life but to be saved from being alive. ([Location 6382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6382))
- When King pursues the struggle for social freedom as an end in itself, he is therefore committed to a secular rather than a religious cause. In King’s own account, he chose the ministry because of “an inescapable urge to serve society” rather than because of any religious revelation: “My call to the ministry was not a miraculous or supernatural something; on the contrary, it was an inner urge calling me to serve humanity.” ([Location 6383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6383))

- While the storm was rattling the windows of the Mason Temple, King laid down the promise of his legacy: It’s all right to talk about “long white robes over yonder,” in all of its symbolism. But ultimately people want some suits and dresses and shoes to wear down here. It’s all right to talk about “streets flowing with milk and honey,” but God has commanded us to be concerned about the slums down here, and his children who can’t eat three square meals a day. It’s all right to talk about the new Jerusalem, but one day, God’s preacher must talk about the new New York, the new Atlanta, the new Philadelphia, the new Los Angeles, the new Memphis, Tennessee. This is what we have to do.88 ([Location 6391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6391))
- speak of the new Memphis—rather than the new Jerusalem—is to avow that we can achieve our collective emancipation in this life. The new Memphis is the object of a secular faith, a spiritual cause that moves us to take action and fight to establish the social conditions for mutual recognition of our freedom. ([Location 6397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6397))
- Because it is a vision of collective emancipation that can become a reality only through our generational efforts, it does not project a timeless eternity where we will all come together as one. Rather, King’s vision of the new Memphis is committed to a temporal future that we ourselves may not live to see. Like King, we may not get there. Yet we can act on behalf of the new Memphis, we can own it as our spiritual cause, we can make it our creed through our deeds. ([Location 6421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6421))
- More than any other form of collective action, a general strike makes explicit the social division of labor that sustains our lives. A general strike in Memphis would have brought home in the most concrete way that the city could not function without the labor of the black population who were working full-time but nevertheless living in poverty. As Honey argues in his study of the Memphis strike, “nonviolent direct action on such a scale would have marked a turning point in the trajectory of the black freedom struggles of the 1960s,”91 which could have led to a further radicalization of the movement led by King. ([Location 6433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6433))
- There is no way to assess all the consequences of King’s death, or to estimate what he could have accomplished. What can be said is that the murder of King belongs to a number of murders of socialist organizers in the 1960s, along with other forms of violent repression that gradually weakened the struggle for freedom. The sanitation workers in Memphis did win their strike, and their labor conditions were improved, but the larger project to which the strike belonged for King (the Poor People’s Campaign) was defeated shortly after his death. ([Location 6452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6452))
- I relate these events because it should never be forgotten that the historical defeats of socialist movements are not merely a matter of having an insufficient analysis or an insufficient strategy. The defeats are also deeply linked to the asymmetry of capitalist power relations and the all too real violence exercised to suppress attempts to organize for the sake of a different vision of society. ([Location 6459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6459))
- As the political-economical framework of the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s gradually shifted toward neoliberal capitalism, the very idea of “freedom” predominantly became part of a right-wing discourse, where the freedom of the market to operate for the sake of profit explicitly took precedence over the freedom of we the people to recognize ourselves—to recognize our commitments—in the institutions we maintain. ([Location 6462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6462))
- That we prioritize profit is not reducible to the manipulations of a corporate elite, since the priority of profit is built into how we measure our social wealth from the beginning. For the same reason, that we collectively value the “growth” of capital as the final purpose of our economy is not reducible to the reigning ideology of neoliberal capitalism. Rather, the purpose of our economy is beyond democratic deliberation under any form of capitalism, since the defining purpose of capital accumulation is built into how we produce our social wealth in the first place. ([Location 6501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6501))
- It does not make sense to argue that the problem is capitalism and at the same time argue that the solution is the redistribution of capital wealth. Yet this argument is routinely made on the Left today. The form of the argument is a contradiction in terms: it asserts that the problem is capitalism and that the solution is capitalism. The contradictory form of the argument is covered over by a sleight of hand, whereby capitalism is tacitly defined as neoliberalism and redistribution is tacitly defined as an alternative to capitalism. ([Location 6514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6514))
- there is only one fundamental definition of capitalism. Capitalism is a historical form of life in which wage labor is the foundation of social wealth. We live in a global capitalist world because all of us depend for our survival on the social wealth generated by wage labor. In order to generate wealth through the social form of the wage relation, we must exploit labor time and consume commodities that are made for profit. The production of all our goods and services is mediated by the social form of wage labor, since even how much free time we have to produce goods or services for nonprofit depends on the wage we receive or the capital we have. Moreover, the production of the capital wealth that is distributed in the form of wages requires that there is a “growth” of value in the economy, which is possible only if we continue to exploit and commodify our lives for the sake of profit. Under capitalism our collective spiritual cause—that for the sake of which we labor—is profit. ([Location 6527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6527))
- That our spiritual cause under capitalism is profit is not reducible to an ideological worldview, a conscious belief, or a psychological disposition. Profit is our spiritual cause not because of what we have to think but because of what we have to do under capitalism. We cannot maintain ourselves—cannot reproduce our lives—without the surplus value that is transformed into profit and accumulated in the form of capital that is distributed as wealth. ([Location 6534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6534))
- Let me emphasize here that capitalism is a historical form of life and that profit is a spiritual cause of what we do, rather than a natural cause. The point is that capitalism does not reflect an original state of nature and does not finally determine who we can be. As living beings, we seek self-satisfaction—and there is nothing degrading about being alive, nothing sinful about seeking self-satisfaction—but since we are spiritually living beings it is not naturally given what counts as self-satisfaction for us. ([Location 6540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6540))
- Moreover, if our collective spiritual cause is profit, all of us will tend to understand ourselves as individuals who have no intrinsic motivation to care for the common good, since we cannot see ourselves in the collective purpose of our society. Indeed, no one can see herself in the purpose of profit, since it treats our lives as means rather than as ends in themselves. This is why capitalism is an inherently alienating form of social life.

- Since profit is our collective spiritual cause under capitalism, which determines how we materially reproduce our lives, we cannot overcome its power through mere individual will or a change of the official worldview of our society. Rather, we must practically transform how we sustain our lives all the way down to the production of the social goods that we need. ([Location 6550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6550))
- We can discover our individual abilities through activities of teaching, learning, and leisure, as well as come to understand our collective needs by sharing the socially necessary forms of labor. ([Location 6570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6570))
- The point of democratic socialism is not to impose a general consensus regarding what matters, but to sustain a form of life that makes it possible for us to own the question of what is worth doing with our lives—what we value individually as well as collectively—as an irreducible question of our lives. ([Location 6576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6576))
- since such security would eliminate our freedom. The point is rather to have a society that enables our cooperation in mutual recognition of the freedom of one another. Nothing can secure the actual exercise of mutual recognition, but mutual recognition can be enabled or disabled depending on the principles to which we strive to hold ourselves, depending on the spiritual cause that moves our actions in social space and time. For our mutual recognition to be enabled rather than disabled, the purposive principles of our society must be possible to grasp in practice as being for the sake of both the common good and our individual ability to lead a life. To be emancipated rather than alienated we must be able to see ourselves—to recognize our own commitment to social freedom—in the purposive principles of our society. These principles must do justice to the inseparability of our material and spiritual life, to how economic questions of priority are at the heart of our exercise of freedom both individually and collectively. The principles of democratic socialism designate what those principles of a free society must be. ([Location 6582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6582))
- Likewise, the institution of marriage will no longer be mediated by religious faith or capitalist property rights, and there will be multiple forms of institutionalizing partnerships. For these very reasons, however, the partnerships in question will be explicitly recognized as ends in themselves. Thus, it will make all the more sense to have ceremonies that acknowledge and celebrate those who are willing to take the risk of making a life-defining commitment to another person. Finally—recalling the issue I pursued in chapter 1—our funeral ceremonies will be able to honor and avow the devastating loss of an irreplaceable person. Rather than disown our mourning through the supposed consolation of eternal life, we will be able to own our pain as something that we ought to feel in the face of death. ([Location 6595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6595))
- On the contrary, only from the standpoint of secular faith can we understand the actual significance of baptisms, marriages, and funerals, as expressions of historical commitments that matter because we have to sustain them. The Hegelian insight regarding religious practices—that “God” is a name for the communal norms that we have legislated to ourselves—is therefore necessary but not sufficient. To complete our emancipation, we ought to remove all remaining forms of political theology by removing any appeal to “God” in favor of the explicit democratic recognition that what ultimately matters is our relations to one another. ([Location 6604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6604))
    - mw:: Yes, but this alo feels somehow t most far awat
- At the end of the day all forms of political theology are antidemocratic, since they assume that we must defer to a higher authority than we the people in order to hold together as a community. The movement toward democratic socialism is thus inseparable from the overcoming of political theology and the withering away of religious faith. ([Location 6609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6609))
- To make our emancipation actual will require both our political mobilizations and our rational arguments; it will require our general strikes and our systematic reflections, our labor and our love, our anxiety and our passion. We only have a chance to achieve democratic socialism if we grasp that everything is at stake in what we do with our finite time together. We only have a chance to make it a reality if we help one another to own our only life. This is how we overcome and how we move forward—not toward the new Jerusalem but toward the new Memphis, the new Los Angeles, the new Chicago, the new New Haven, and the new New York. ([Location 6616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6616))
- Hegel makes a similar distinction in analyzing how certain animals—as distinct from plants—have a capacity for “self-enjoyment,” which is expressed through what Hegel calls “the artistic impulse” that is one aspect of “the constructive instinct” of animals (Philosophy of Nature, pp. 406–409). Most suggestively, Hegel argues that birdsong expresses a capacity for self-enjoyment that is distinguishable from the activity of mere self-preservation. Birdsong is a “distinterested” activity, not in the sense of being contemplative but in the sense of being an end in itself for the bird—enjoyed for its own sake (Philosophy of Nature, p. 409). ([Location 7006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=7006))
- For an excellent analysis of the difference between Marx and earlier socialist writers on this point, see William Roberts, Marx’s Inferno: The Political Theory of Capital. Roberts’s deeply insightful reading of Capital appeared toward the end of my work on this book, but I hope to engage it on another occasion.

> To be finite means primarily two things: to be dependent on others and to live in relation to death. I am finite because I cannot maintain my life on my own and because I will die. Likewise, the projects to which I am devoted are finite because they live only through the efforts of those who are committed to them and will cease to be if they are abandoned. ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=75))

---

> An eternal activity—just as much as an eternal rest—is of concern to no one, since it cannot be stopped and does not have to be maintained by anyone. The problem is not that an eternal activity would be “boring” but that it would not be intelligible as my activity. Any activity of mine (including a boring activity) requires that I sustain it. In an eternal activity, there cannot be a person who is bored—or involved in any other way—since an eternal activity does not depend on being sustained by anyone.

Strikes me as a naive and maateriallisticc nswer.

> The sense of finitude—the sense of the ultimate fragility of everything we care about—is at the heart of what I call secular faith. To have secular faith is to be devoted to a life that will end, to be dedicated ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=99))

Lol like youre the first person to ever call it that. Come on man

---

> All world religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity) hold that the highest form of existence or the most desirable form of life is eternal rather than finite. To be religious—or to adopt a religious perspective on life—is to regard our finitude as a lack, an illusion, or a fallen state of being. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=108))

.... I guess, kind of, but feels also obtuse. Even tho i ultinatelltlt agreee with haaaglund. Buddhisst recoofbittion off emmptiineess is not about eternnal.

---

> To have secular faith is to acknowledge that the object of our faith is dependent on the practice of faith. I call it secular faith, since the object of devotion does not exist independently of those who believe in its importance and who keep it alive through their fidelity. The object of secular faith—e.g., the life we are trying to lead, the institutions we are trying to build, the community we are trying to achieve—is inseparable from what we do and how we do it. Through the practice of secular faith, we bind ourselves to a normative ideal (a conception of who we ought to be as individuals and as a community). The ideal itself, however, depends on how we keep faith with our commitment and remains open to being challenged, transformed, or overturned. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=123))

Ok yes

---

> The object of religious faith—whether God or any other form of infinite being—is ultimately regarded as separable from the practice of faith, since it does not depend on any form of finite life. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=129))

This is just plainly wrong. Christianity depends on essential faith of story of Jesus. If its wrong abandon all ye faith.

---

> As William James observes in the conclusion to his classic work The Varieties of Religious Experience, the subordination of the finite to the eternal is the common denominator both for orthodox religions and for all forms of religious mysticism. “This world may indeed, as science assures us, some day burn up or freeze,” James writes, but for those with religious faith “God’s existence is the guarantee of an ideal order that shall be permanently preserved.”2 Accordingly, from a religious point of view, the end of the world is ultimately not a tragedy. ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=134))

Yes, this is the primary point

---

> For the same reason, climate change and the possible destruction of the Earth cannot be seen as an existential threat from the standpoint of religious faith. To grasp the existential threat to yourself and to future generations, you have to believe not only that life is finite but also that everything valuable—everything that matters—depends on finite life. This is exactly what religious faith denies. ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=143))

Hm. Will stop noting now

> If you are aiming for eternal life, finite life does not matter for its own sake but serves as a vehicle to attain salvation. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=155))

---

> My point, however, is that if you care for our form of life as an end in itself, you are acting on the basis of secular faith, even if you claim to be religious. Religious faith can entail obedience to moral norms, but it cannot recognize that the ultimate purpose of what we do—the ultimate reason it matters how we treat one another and the Earth—is our fragile life together.

> The ability to ask this question—the question of what we ought to do with our time—is the basic condition for what I call spiritual freedom. To lead a free, spiritual life (rather than a life determined merely by natural instincts), I must be responsible for what I do. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=206))

> In caring about anyone or anything, we are already practicing an implicit form of secular faith in what we do, since we are devoted to someone or something that is fragile. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=233))

---

> The second thesis postulates a religious plenitude: to compensate for its normative deficit, secular life must turn to religion as the unique and privileged resource of moral-political instruction without which society cannot cohere. As Gordon shows, these two theses of political theology are remarkably persistent not only in the history of ideas but also in contemporary philosophy and sociology.5 ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=241))

Gramsci argues that a failure of the left is inability to take place of religion in some sense

---

> The most influential version of such a negative assessment of secular life was formulated by the sociologist Max Weber in the early twentieth century. Weber’s famous claim that secular life suffers from a “disenchantment” of the world continues to serve as an alibi for political theology and to instill the sense that a society without religious faith is hopelessly lacking. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=249))

Cc Burbea enchanting the cosmos

---

> First, disenchantment means that we no longer appeal to any “mysterious incalculable forces”—or any other forms of supernatural explanation—for what happens in the world. Rather, the form of reason becomes an instrumental reason, which assumes that “we can, in principle, control everything by means of calculation.” Second, Weber takes disenchantment to mean that “the ultimate and most sublime values have retreated from public life,” so that we are deprived of any form of “genuine community.” Third, Weber laments that disenchantment entails that death is no longer “a meaningful phenomenon.” ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=253))

> The dissatisfactions of our current state of secularization are not due to the idea of progress. As Robbins emphasizes, the dissatisfactions are rather due to “the failure of progress,” namely, our “failure to achieve a level of social justice that the premodern world did not even strive to achieve.” ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=332))

---

> Marx’s thinking is often conflated with the totalitarian communist regimes of the twentieth century, but I will argue that he is the most important inheritor of the secular commitment to freedom and democracy. In contrast to Weber and other political theologians, Marx has no nostalgia for the premodern world. Rather, he makes clear that both capitalism and liberalism are historical conditions of possibility for the emancipation that he espouses. This is why Marx, in his critique of capitalism and liberalism, takes issue with these forms of life on their own terms. He seeks to show that capitalism and liberalism require their own overcoming by virtue of the secular commitment they bear within themselves to freedom and democracy. ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=336))

> The workers’ movements organized youth groups, choirs, book clubs, sports teams, and other communal activities. They pursued democracy on the ground by publishing daily newspapers and journals that provided a forum for ongoing, open debate about the stakes and goals of the movement.

Denning disxusses this as well

---

> The words of a German miner, aged thirty-three and with eight children, echo the testimony of many workers from this period. “The modern labor movement,” he said in 1912, “enriches me and all my friends through the growing light of recognition. We understand that we are no longer the anvil but rather the hammer that forms the future of our children, and that feeling is worth more than gold.”13 This sense of spiritual freedom—that we can be the subjects of our history and not merely subject to our history—is at the core of Marx’s notion of emancipation. ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=349))

---

> The task is all the more important because the appeal to freedom in recent decades has been appropriated for agendas on the political right, where the idea of freedom serves to defend “the free market” and is largely reduced to a formal conception of individual liberty. In response, many thinkers on the political left have retreated from or even explicitly rejected the idea of freedom. This is a fatal mistake. Any emancipatory politics—as well as any critique of capitalism—requires a conception of freedom. Only in light of a commitment to freedom can we render anything intelligible as oppression, exploitation, or alienation. Moreover, only in light of a commitment to freedom can we give an account of what we are trying to achieve and why it matters. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=369))

---

> The economic organization of our society is not a mere instrumental means for the pursuit of individual ends. Rather, our shared economy is itself expressive of how we understand the relation between means and ends. Economic matters are not abstract but concern the most general and concrete questions of what we do with our time. As I will show in detail, how we organize our economy is intrinsic to how we live together and what we collectively value. ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=376))

---

> Marx’s analyses of economic questions proceed from a philosophical grasp of what it means to be living and free. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=380))

---

> A living being cannot simply exist but must do something to stay alive. The need of the living organism to sustain itself—the labor required to keep ourselves alive—minimally defines what Marx calls the realm of necessity. Because we are living beings, we must work to maintain ourselves. Yet, all the time we have is not necessarily required to ensure our biological survival and it is an open question for us what we should do with the surplus of time. This is why, for Marx, we also live in the realm of freedom. We are able to engage our life activity as a free activity, since we can ask ourselves what to do and if it is the right thing to do. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=382))

---

> through technological innovations (from simple tools to advanced machines) we can reduce the time we need to expend on securing our survival, by replacing large parts of our living labor with nonliving capacities for producing social goods. We can thereby decrease our realm of necessity (the time required to keep ourselves alive) and increase our realm of freedom ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=387))

This hasnt happened tho

---

> To live a free life, it is not enough that we have the right to freedom. We must have access to the material resources as well as the forms of education that allow us to pursue our freedom and to “own” the question of what to do with our time. What belongs to each one of us—what is irreducibly our own—is not property or goods but the time of our lives. ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=395))

---

> As Marx underlines: “My own existence is social activity, and therefore that which I make of myself, I make of myself for society and with the awareness of myself as a social being.”17 Hence, to “own” your life is not to be independent but to be able to acknowledge your dependence. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=399))

---

> If you cannot see yourself in the purpose of your occupation, then your labor time is alienated, even if your job entails a high salary and great social prestige. This may seem like a small problem compared with the labor conditions of most of the people who produce the commodities that populate our world. There is certainly a harrowing difference between those who assemble our computers in factories or manufacture our clothes in sweatshops and those of us who turn on our computers or put on our clothes while forgetting the labor conditions under which they were produced. Yet from Marx’s perspective these issues are all connected, since they concern how our shared economic life is organized and how it is inimical to our freedom. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=409))

---

> The aim, then, is to decrease the realm of necessity and increase the realm of freedom by making the relation between the two a democratic question. We will always have to work—for better or for worse—but what will count as necessary labor and what will count as free labor is a matter of our commitments and our social organization. For the same reason, the relation between necessity and freedom cannot be settled once and for all but must always be negotiated. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=428))

---

> There are no definitive political solutions in Marx but rather the clarification of a vital problem. What we need to negotiate—both individually and collectively—is how to cultivate the finite time that is the condition of our freedom. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=431))

---

> The promise of achieving freedom through wage labor is necessarily contradicted, however, by how we measure the value of our lives under capitalism. Marx’s critique of the measure of value under capitalism is the most important argument in all of his work, but also the most misunderstood. Contrary to a widely held assumption—among both his followers on the Left and his critics on the Right—Marx does not subscribe to a general labor theory of value, which holds that labor is the necessary source of all wealth. Rather, Marx argues that the production of wealth under capitalism entails a historically specific measure of value (socially necessary labor time), which contradicts the value of free time and must be overcome for the sake of our emancipation.

> This is why Marx emphasizes that the critique of religion must be accompanied by a critique of the existing forms of our life together. That those who are enslaved or live in poverty may need faith in God to carry on with their lives is not a reason to promote religious faith but a reason to abolish slavery and poverty. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=464))

---

> Thus, Augustine’s own account gives us reasons to keep faith in temporal life and overcome faith in eternity. To pursue this perspective would be to write a secular—rather than a religious—confession. I read such a secular confession in Karl Ove Knausgaard’s My Struggle, which can be seen as a contemporary response to Augustine. Knausgaard’s painstaking attention to a secular life places us in the midst of everyday existence. Like Augustine, he explores the care that binds us to others and how the experience of time cuts through every moment. But while Augustine seeks to turn us toward eternity, Knausgaard turns us back toward our finite lives as the heart of everything that matters. The animating principle of his writing is one of attachment to finite life, which is all the more profound because it remains faithful to the ambivalence of any attachment. Devoted to secular life, we can be moved both to bliss and devastation, hope and despair, success and failure. Knausgaard, then, makes vivid what it means to keep faith in a life that is bound to die. This secular faith, I argue, opens the possibility for all passion and meaningful engagement.

> Yet, insofar as they cannot understand their time as free time—insofar as they cannot ask themselves what they ought to do with their time—even animals with highly refined capacities for self-enjoyment remain within the bounds of what I call “natural” freedom. In contrast, what I call spiritual freedom requires that the agent in question can ask herself how she should spend her time and be responsive to the risk that she is wasting her life. Without the relation to such a risk, we would not be able to lead a spiritual life, since we could never engage the question of what we ought to do with our time and what matters to us. ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=553))

> For Marx—contrary to a persistent misconception—the overcoming of capitalism is not meant to abolish democracy but to make actual democracy possible.

> What emerges through this account is not simply a crisis of faith, in the sense that the death of his wife makes him doubt the existence of God. What emerges is something deeper: an insight that his faith in God cannot offer any consolation for the loss of a loved one. If a mother is mourning the death of her child, Lewis writes, “she may still hope to ‘glorify God and enjoy him forever,’ ” which may be “a comfort to the God-aimed, eternal spirit within her. But not to her motherhood. The specifically maternal happiness must be written off. Never, in any place or time, will she have her son on her knees, or bathe him, or tell him a story, or plan for his future, or see her grandchild.”5 ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=636))

---

> This is why Lewis emphasizes that the Bible does not support visions of an afterlife that project reunions with the people you have loved throughout your life. Such visions are not directed toward God as the End, but at most treat God as a means for retrieving the mortal beloved. The vision of an afterlife where Lewis’s wife would welcome him is attached to living on with the beloved rather than to dwelling in the eternity of God.

> Spinoza presents a clear version of what I call the religious aspiration to eternity. This aspiration is not limited to visions of a transcendent afterlife, but pertains just as well to an immanent ideal of attaining complete peace of mind. Indeed, I define as religious any ideal of being absolved from the pain of loss. While many religious ideals include pain and suffering as necessary steps on the way to salvation, the ultimate goal is to be absolved from vulnerability.

> The most fundamental form of secular faith is the faith that life is worth living, which is intrinsic to all forms of care. In caring about our own lives and the lives of others, we necessarily believe that life is worth living. This is a matter of faith because we cannot prove that life is worth living despite all the suffering it entails. That life is worth living cannot be demonstrated through a logical deduction or rational calculation. Rather, the faith that life is worth living sustains us even when our lives seem to be unbearable or intolerable. Moreover, it is because we believe that life is worth living that our lives can appear as unbearable or intolerable in the first place. ([Location 794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=794))

---

> First, secular faith is an existential commitment. The faith that life is worth living is not caused by some vital force but is constituted by the commitment to a fragile form of life. The form of life to which we are committed is normative, since we lead our lives in light of a conception of who we ought to be and what we ought to do. Our existential commitment to a form of life is not reducible to a drive for self-preservation and is a condition for even the most altruistic deeds. ([Location 803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=803))

---

> Second, secular faith is a necessary uncertainty. In being committed to someone or something, I must have faith in the future and in those on whom I depend. I cannot be certain of what others will do, so I have to relate to them on the basis of faith. Faith provides the positive chance of having a relation to others—of trusting them—but it also opens the negative threat of being deceived or betrayed. The same holds for any relation to the future.

> Third, the precariousness of secular faith is a motivational force. In keeping faith with a form of life—whether expressed through the commitment to a person, a project, or a principle—I have to believe that the object of faith is precarious. My commitment to the continued life of someone or something is inseparable from my sense that it cannot be taken for granted.

> One who has attained nirvana does not suffer from the loss of anything, since he or she is detached from everything that is finite.

> Even the greatest moments of happiness in love—gathering and deepening the qualitative experience of a shared life—cannot be contained in an instant, since the moment is bound up with a network of meaning that extends to the memory of a shared past and anticipations of a future together. As Taylor himself emphasizes: “The deepest, most powerful kind of happiness, even in the moment, is plunged into a sense of meaning,” so that “when you look back on your life together, those happy moments, those travels in the sun, were bathed in the awareness of other years, other travels, which seemed to come alive in the present one.” ([Location 961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=961))

> If you truly believed in the existence of eternity—and in the superior value of eternal life—there would be no reason to mourn the loss of a finite life. Thus, Buddhism teaches that a fully enlightened person is beyond the pain of mourning and loss, having extinguished the desire to hold on to any life that is passing away. The same logic is articulated by the founding figures of Christianity. Saint Augustine forcefully argues against mourning the loss of mortal lives and upon the death of his mother—when he cannot hold back his tears—he condemns his weeping as an act of sin. Martin Luther in his turn declares, upon the death of his daughter Magdalena in 1542, that “I rejoice in the spirit, but sorrow in the flesh,” emphasizing to the congregation after her funeral that “we Christians ought not to mourn.” ([Location 1017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1017))

> This experience of time is, according to Augustine, at work in every moment of our lives. You may think that you are present here today. But in everything you do, you are divided between the past and the future. As you get up in the morning, part of the day is already gone and what remains of the day is still to come. Even if you wake up at dawn and focus only on the first hour of the day, you will never be able to seize it as a present moment. “An hour,” Augustine writes, “is itself made of fleeting moments. Whatever part of the hour has flown away is past. What remains of the hour is future.” ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1143))

> The result is a life in which opportunity and danger are inseparable. The light of bliss—even when it floods your life—is always attended by the shadow of loss. “Either loss of what we love and have gained,” Augustine explains, “or failure to gain what we love and have hoped for.”5 This is the condition of secular life. Augustine uses the Latin word saecularis to evoke how we are bounded by time, through our commitments to a shared world and history, as well as to generations before and beyond us.

> In contrast, the aim of Stoicism is to make us independent of everything that may upset us. This requires that we stop believing in the value of anything that can make us suffer. If something is taken away from us, we will not feel bereaved because we are not attached to anything that can be lost. And if someone violates us, we will not be angry or retaliate because we are not attached to any part of ourselves that is vulnerable to harm. Through the practice of detachment, we will maintain peace of mind regardless of what happens. The goal of Stoicism is literally apathy (apatheia): the freedom from all passions, since passions hold us hostage ([Location 1301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1301))

> According to Augustine, you should therefore convert your love for finite beings (cupiditas) into a love of God’s eternal presence (caritas).

Even when they last for a long time, we can lose them at any moment. This is why Buddhism advocates detachment from everything that is impermanent. To be attached to finite life is to put yourself at risk, to expose yourself to being hurt by what happens.

> Augustine’s official narrative maintains that the God he refused was not the true Christian God he discovered later in his life. But Augustine’s writing also tells another story. The reason he refused to seek comfort in God was not because he had an inadequate understanding of divine eternity, but because he loved his friend—and the life they shared together—as an end in itself. He wanted their lives to go on, rather than ascend to eternity. As Augustine himself makes clear, such secular love is incompatible with a religious love of eternity. A religious love of eternity treats the mortal beloved as a means and must be careful not to love him in his own right. As Augustine explains in the first book of his Confessions, “My sin was in this—that I looked for pleasures, exaltations, truths not in God Himself but in His creatures (myself and the rest), and so I fell straight into sorrows, confusions, and mistakes.” ([Location 1405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1405))

> the bond between love and grief is what I am asking us to see. To pursue this vision would be to write a secular—as distinct from a religious—confession. Such a confession would take up Augustine’s explorations of how the identity of the self depends on the fragile operations of memory and how the experience of time cuts through every moment. Like Augustine in his Confessions it would declare: “See, my life is distended” (Ecce distentio est vita mea).41 But unlike in Augustine, the distention of time would not be regarded as a fallen state from which we need to ([Location 1506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1506))

> The animating principle of Knausgaard’s writing is rather one of attachment, which is all the more profound because it remains faithful to the ambivalence of any attachment. The credo of his work, I will show, is a phrase that recurs throughout My Struggle and is difficult to translate. “Det gjelder å feste blikket,” Knausgaard writes in Norwegian. The phrase could be rendered as “one must focus the gaze” or “what matters is to focus the gaze.” But the Norwegian verb that we would then translate as to focus (å feste) literally means “to attach,” and the phrase is clearly a personal injunction rather than a simple statement. So a better translation would be: attach yourself to what you see, focus your gaze by attaching yourself to what you see. This is the imperative of My Struggle.

---

> From a religious point of view, a finite life without redemption is indeed soulless and banal. This view is inherited even by many who do not have religious faith—regarding their lives as futile because they lack a sense of the eternal—and Knausgaard is tempted by it in a number of the essayistic reflections that pervade My Struggle. He repeatedly claims that art aspires to retrieve a sense of the holy, while lamenting that we can no longer attain it. “The longing and melancholia that Romantic art expresses is a longing for this,” he writes with reference to a religious sense of the holy, “and a mourning of its loss. At least that is how I interpret my own attraction to the Romantic in art.” ([Location 1668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1668))

---

> The aim is to attach himself more deeply to his life, rather than transcend it. From this perspective, it is Augustine’s mystical ecstasies that are soulless and banal, since they seek to leave the world behind in favor of an eternal presence where nothing happens. What is profound in Augustine is not the ascent to heaven but the descent into time and memory. It is the latter, descending movement that Knausgaard follows in his practice as a writer. ([Location 1688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1688))

---

> Knausgaard’s writing develops a careful attention to the time and place where he finds himself. The fundamental form of such attention is the turn toward what is happening at this very moment—trying to capture life as it unfolds right now. The aim is to slow down the experience of temporality, to dilate moments of time and linger in their qualities. This movement does not yield a stable presence but, on the contrary, a stronger sense of how the present moment is ceasing to be and has to be held in memory, as it opens onto a future that exceeds it.

> The distention of time—how every moment trembles on the verge of the past and the future—thus appears in the light of secular passion.

Only someone who is finite can sense the miracle of being alive. ([Location 1783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1783))

> Rather than a transcendent topic of writing, which has always left Marcel’s imagination blank, it is “this life, the memories of its times of sadness, its times of joy”60 that he comes to see as the basis for his book. “The greatness of true art,” he declares, “lies in rediscovering, grasping hold of, and making us recognize…this reality which we run a real risk of dying without having known, and which is quite simply our life.”61 ([Location 1795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1795))

> Knausgaard thereby reveals a difficulty that Proust tends to conceal. If you focus only on the distant past (as Marcel does), it is relatively easy to gain a new appreciation of your life, since you can transform the past into an object of contemplation that no longer makes any direct demands on your engagement. You can dwell on details you previously overlooked, absorb the impact of events you did not understand at the time, and even feel a surge of nostalgia for things you did not enjoy when you first experienced them. Indeed, the sense that all these things are irrevocably gone can make them appear more precious than they actually were. Your nostalgia, then, can come to shelter you from the demands of a life that still has to be lived. ([Location 1831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1831))

---

> In contrast, the structure of My Struggle looks like a deliberate inversion of the one that shapes In Search of Lost Time. While Marcel’s book ends with him becoming an author through the decision to write the story of his life, Karl Ove’s book begins with him already being an author who decides to write the story of his life and ends with the declaration that he is no longer an author after the completion of his book. “I will enjoy, really enjoy, the thought that I am no longer an author,” are the last words of My Struggle, followed by a separate page with two sole sentences that address his wife and children: “For Linda, Vanja, Heidi, and John. I love you.” ([Location 1842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1842))

> Death is the background against which life can light up as something cherished and irreplaceable, but it is also the background that can extinguish all light: “Death makes life meaningless, because everything we have ever striven for ceases when life does, and it makes life meaningful, too, because its presence makes the little we have of it indispensable, every moment precious.”72 ([Location 1969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=1969))

> While these two perspectives are apparently opposed, they are united in their denial that death entails the loss of a life we should try to hold on to. In the first case, we are told to detach from the life that is lost in favor of an immortal soul. In the second case, we are told to detach from the life that is lost in favor of the continuation of matter. Both perspectives thus deny the tragedy of death. Only a secular faith—which remains committed to a life that irrevocably is lost in death—can counter these two forms of denial. Indeed, only a secular faith can account for why death is a tragic loss at all. The sense of tragic loss depends on keeping faith in the irreplaceable value of a life that is gone forever. Nature does not care whether we live or die, but that makes it all the more imperative that we care and remember what has been taken away.

> The remarkable thing with Knausgaard’s writing is how the experience of mortality is allowed to be the source of both fear and love, terror and beauty. The anxiety before death is not something that can or should be overcome. Rather, it is an expression of love for a life that will cease to be. ([Location 2012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2012))

---

> These are all forms of embodied time, through which we distend our lives beyond our physical location in space. At the same time, we are necessarily bound to a physical body. The wager of My Struggle is to hold these two perspectives together. We are spirit but also matter and the former depends on the latter. We can compose our lives—give them form and meaning—but in the end we will disappear in a meaningless process of decomposition. Knausgaard makes us confront such decomposition, while keeping faith in the value of finite existence. He turns us back to our lives to see both form and formlessness, integration and disintegration. ([Location 2044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2044))

---

> Nazi ideology is thus another version—a particularly sinister version—of the religious longing for purity. Knausgaard acknowledges and reckons with such longing for purity, but his writing is an active resistance to any temptation of purification. Indeed, My Struggle is devoted to the very imperfection that Mein Kampf sets out to erase. Nothing will save us, since irresolution, difficulty, and frailty are essential parts of the lives we care about.

---

> This is why My Struggle—which apparently is so devoted to the I—ultimately turns out to be dependent on you.

> The story of Abraham’s devotion to God—and the sacrifice of his beloved son Isaac—is both one of the most enigmatic and most poignant episodes in the Bible. Sparsely told as an existential drama of religious faith, it continues to provoke passionate responses and troubled questions. These questions are all the more pressing because Abraham is regarded as the “father of faith” in all three major monotheistic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam). How we understand Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac is therefore a central part of how we understand religious faith. ([Location 2092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2092))

---

> While these questions have been debated for centuries, no one has pursued them with the philosophical depth and literary imagination of a young Danish philosopher in 1843. During a stay in Berlin, Søren Kierkegaard set out to bring the story of Abraham and Isaac back to life for a contemporary audience. The resulting work is Fear and Trembling, a book that more than any other has made Kierkegaard live on as an author and thinker. Professional philosophers as well as lay readers, religious believers as well as atheists, keep returning to Fear and Trembling as a profound exploration of what it means to have faith. ([Location 2099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2099))

---

> Thus, no matter how subjectively certain we may be about what has happened, there is an element of objective uncertainty in our knowledge, since our account of the past cannot ever be definitive and may be refuted. Likewise, we may develop better methods for predicting what will happen, but the future remains objectively uncertain, since we cannot know what has not yet taken place. ([Location 2154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2154))

---

> These forms of uncertainty mark our experience of the present itself, which is already becoming past and becoming related to the future. A moment is never a still point of certainty but always passing away (Forbigaaende) and opening itself to what may come (Tilkommende). This is why life—in Kierkegaard’s most famous phrase—can only be understood backwards but must be lived forwards.

> “Passion” and “appropriation” are two of Kierkegaard’s favorite words to describe such a commitment. For an activity to matter in an existential sense, it is not enough that you learn to do it correctly: you have to be passionate about doing it right and appropriate the activity as your own by putting yourself at stake in it. ([Location 2174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2174))

---

> By committing yourself to a person, a political struggle, or a way of life, you become dependent on something whose continued existence is objectively uncertain. Yet Kierkegaard maintains that it is only through such an existential commitment that you can become a self. Biologically we may be described as human beings, but who we are—our “self” in Kierkegaard’s existential sense—is defined by what we are committed to as well as how we sustain those commitments. ([Location 2189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2189))

---

> “The earnest understanding,” Kierkegaard writes, “is that if death is night then life is day, that if no work can be done at night then work can be done during the day; and the terse but impelling cry of earnestness, like death’s terse cry, is: This very day.” ([Location 2231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2231))

---

> This is the blueprint for Abraham’s religious faith in Fear and Trembling. As long as Abraham keeps his faith in God, he is insulated from the actual experience of losing what he loves. For Kierkegaard, this is the deepest virtue of religious faith. As long as you keep religious faith, you cannot be defeated by loss. ([Location 2252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2252))

---

> In contrast, secular faith necessarily remains vulnerable. As long as you keep secular faith, you can be defeated by loss. Affirming your life-defining commitment as a parent—and loving your child wholeheartedly—does not protect you from the pain of conflict, the bereavement of broken hopes, or the possible devastation of losing your child. On the contrary, it is because you are keeping faith with your child—and holding on to your life-defining commitment as a parent—that you are all the more vulnerable to these experiences.

> My secular faith that life is worth living may carry me through devastating experiences, but it is essentially fragile, since I cannot sustain it on my own. My secular faith—my ability to hope for the future—relies on others who recognize me, as well as on my own ability to recognize myself. Even if I am all alone, my own sense of myself is inseparable from how I have been received by others and how they have given me resources to live on. Thus, if my son dies, I may be able to go on with my life despite the terrible grief, but at every step of the way I will depend on the world of which I am a part. If I can recollect my love for my son—if I can recognize myself as a loving father who inadvertently lost his son—I may be able to work through the grief and renew my commitment to the future. The pain will never entirely go away, but the memories of what we shared together may give me sustenance. ([Location 2365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2365))

> The risk of such despair is built into any life-defining commitment. To have a life-defining commitment is to acknowledge that I am not self-sufficient but essentially a relational being. My identity is not given but relies on forms of recognition that must be upheld or transformed and that remain fragile at their core. My life-defining commitments give me a world and an identity, but they also underline my finitude and the risk that my world can break down.

---

> Religious faith thus requires a double movement, whereby you renounce trust in the world in favor of trust in God. Rather than rely on finite relations, you place your faith in God. The first movement of religious faith is what Kierkegaard calls infinite resignation, which plays a central role in Fear and Trembling but is most fully elaborated in the Concluding Unscientific Postscript. Infinite resignation does not mean that you give up hope, but that you renounce all forms of hope that depend on a finite world.

> “No merely human love can completely drive out this anxiety, which can very well remain hidden and undetected in the friendly security of a happy life-relationship, but which at times can inexplicably stir deep within and which, when the storms of life begin, is immediately at hand.”35 In contrast, God “remains faithful, every day of your life, whatever happens to you; he remains faithful to you in death; he meets you again in the hereafter as a trustworthy friend.”36 The demanding task is to keep faith in God. As long as you have “given yourself completely to him, had your whole life in him,” he will never let you down, since “he himself eternally guarantees” his own fidelity.

> Nothing is accomplished by merely withdrawing to a monastery, since a monastery belongs as much to the world and to finite life as any other place on earth. Anyone who makes the movement of infinite resignation should become “a stranger in the world of finitude,” but he should “not define his difference from worldliness by foreign dress (this is a contradiction, since with that he defines himself in a worldly way).” ([Location 2454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2454))

---

> We can thus begin to understand why Kierkegaard treats the sacrifice of Isaac as paradigmatic for what it means to have a living religious faith. Even if you do not receive an explicit command from God to sacrifice your son, the absolute telos of eternal happiness requires that you subordinate and ultimately surrender any finite object of your love. This movement of infinite resignation is at the core of what Kierkegaard calls Religiousness A. ([Location 2469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2469))

---

> The infinite resignation of Religiousness A is thus the common denominator for all forms of religious faith worthy of the name. The reason is simple. If you are not willing to sacrifice the finite for the eternal, your living faith—the faith that is revealed by how you actually respond to what happens—is secular rather than religious. You may profess that you believe in God and eternity, but as long as you are not ready to renounce the finite your supposed religious faith is dead, a matter of mere words.

> The “true” Abraham, however, makes a second movement simultaneously with the movement of infinite resignation: the movement of faith. This movement holds that everything is possible for God, even if it seems impossible or absurd from a human perspective. ([Location 2489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2489))

---

> Likewise, Kierkegaard’s modern version of Abraham—the knight of faith—is presented as someone who is utterly committed to finite life. Unlike his counterpart the knight of infinite resignation, who can make only the first movement of renunciation, the knight of faith can make the double movement through which he fully expects to receive the finite even after having given it up. Whereas the knight of infinite resignation becomes “a stranger and an alien”47 in the world of finitude, the knight of faith is described as “the only happy man, the heir to the finite,”48 since he has “this security that makes him delight in finitude as if it were the surest thing of all.”49 ([Location 2495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2495))

---

> In practice, the one who makes the double movement of religious faith is even more brutally indifferent to the fate of the finite than the one who performs the single movement of infinite resignation. The knight of infinite resignation kills Isaac, but at least he recognizes the loss of Isaac. The knight of faith also kills Isaac, but through the double movement of religious faith he does not recognize the actual loss of Isaac because he is fully confident that he will get him back even though he has taken his life. He can stand there with Isaac’s severed head in his hand and still believe that he will live happily ever after with his son. ([Location 2514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2514))

---

> At every moment in his sacrifice of Isaac, Abraham has to make both the movement of infinite resignation and the movement of faith. Only through such a double movement can he kill Isaac while at the same time maintaining that he loves him. As long as he makes the double movement, he can never experience the devastating loss of Isaac, since at every moment he renews his faith that his son will be given back to him. This is how Abraham’s love of Isaac becomes an entirely internal affair, where any concern for Isaac in his own right is eliminated. By virtue of his religious faith, Abraham is no longer responsive to what actually befalls Isaac, or to how he may be feeling, except insofar as it aligns with Abraham’s own hopes. The impact of any negative outcome is immediately renounced in favor of the faith that he will receive exactly what he wants, since God can do anything that is needed to arrange it. That is how Abraham sacrifices his care for Isaac. Because Abraham believes that he ultimately cannot lose his son, he can take Isaac’s life. ([Location 2557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2557))

---

> For Kierkegaard, however, the absurdity is the point, since it underlines that the movement of religious faith requires that you relinquish any concern for external probabilities in favor of internal conviction. “By virtue of the absurd to get everything, to get one’s desire totally and completely”68—that is how Fear and Trembling glosses the religious faith that defies any finite understanding. Rather than “find rest in the pain of resignation,” the knight of faith can “find joy by virtue of the absurd” and “live happily every moment,”69 since “he has this security [faith in the absurd] that makes him delight in finitude as if it were the surest thing of all.”70 ([Location 2647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2647))

---

> For the same reason, however, the knight of faith is not actually at stake in any of his commitments. If I am at stake in my commitments, then I must run the risk of despair if I betray my commitments or if everything to which I am committed breaks down. The risk of despair is not a possibility that can be eliminated but a necessary boundary condition for any life-defining commitment. If I have a life-defining commitment, there are things I cannot do and a world I cannot lose on pain of losing myself. The knight of faith believes, on the contrary, that he will be able to go on with his life even if everything is taken away from him, and at every moment he overcomes any form of anxiety. ([Location 2692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2692))

> In destroying his ability to be in despair, he is also destroying his ability to care about anyone or anything that is finite. ([Location 2698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2698))

---

> Yet these characterizations are not meant to repudiate religious faith but to make it appear even more awe-inspiring and sublime. Like many of Kierkegaard’s books, Fear and Trembling is signed by a pseudonymous author—in this case Johannes de Silentio—who narrates the story and speaks directly to the reader. Johannes admits that he himself does not have religious faith and often finds himself “shattered” or “paralyzed” when thinking of Abraham. But this does not prevent Johannes from regarding Abraham as “the greatest of all” and from chastising himself for falling short of the religious faith that is required to sacrifice Isaac. ([Location 2700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2700))

---

> Those who claim to be Christian but still care about the fate of their finite lives, Kierkegaard chastises for lacking a living religious faith. If you are poor and cannot renounce the care for poverty, if you are dying and cannot renounce the care for your life, if you are a loving parent and cannot renounce the care for your child, then you are not a Christian. You may claim that you trust in God, but if you cannot prove it through your actions and through how you respond to what happens, then your religious faith is dead: something you claim to believe even though it does not actually shape how you think and feel. A living religious faith is rather achieved through a double movement, where you renounce the cares that follow from being finite and instead place your trust in God. Even though you are starving, you believe that you will be nourished, even though you are dying, you believe that you will live forever, and even though you are killing your son, you believe that he will be given back to you.

> Only by loving Isaac for his own sake—while recognizing that his life is essentially fragile—can you care for him.

---

> The practice of detachment is a movement of infinite resignation, which requires that you sacrifice your care for the finite in favor of the eternal. In order to be unmoved by what happens, you cannot be responsive to Isaac’s fate. On the contrary, you must remain as insensitive as a mountain.

> A father (Abraham/God) sacrifices his beloved son (Isaac/Jesus). In the Binding of Isaac, the son is taken to Mount Moriah, where his father raises a knife to kill him. This prefigures the Crucifixion of Jesus, where the son is nailed to the cross on Golgotha and slowly dies in agony. In both stories the sacrifice is rewarded and praised as a holy act. Because Abraham was ready to kill Isaac, God blesses his descendants; because Jesus died on the cross, mankind is said to be redeemed from sin. ([Location 2768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2768))

> As scholars of the Hebrew text have shown, there are strong indications that in the original version Abraham chooses to protect Isaac’s life in defiance of the divine command. ([Location 2772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2772))

---

> Abraham is allowed to keep Isaac as a gift from God. There are good textual grounds, however, for regarding the angelic speeches as a later insertion. Both in terms of style and structure, they diverge in striking ways from the rest of the text. Most importantly, if one removes the angelic speeches one will find a consistent narrative where Abraham disobeys God’s command. The angelic speeches would thus have been inserted to cover up Abraham’s disobedience. As Omri Boehm has argued in a careful textual study: “A later redactor interpolated the figure of the angel, thereby shifting responsibility for interrupting the test from Abraham to the angel.” ([Location 2777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2777))

---

> Yet what Kierkegaard laments as “doubt” with regard to religious faith can just as well be read as an affirmation of secular faith. If Abraham disobeys God, it is because he is committed to Isaac as an end in himself. Moreover, it is because he believes that Isaac can actually and irrevocably die. This is the core of secular faith: what you love is worth fighting for even though it is finite and calls for your care because it is finite. ([Location 2791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2791))

> Thus, in both the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, Jesus’s last words express a sense of utter abandonment: Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? (“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”). After repeating this cry, Jesus gives up his last breath and dies. ([Location 2828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2828))

---

> The death of Jesus thus leaves itself open to being read in the light of secular passion. On such a reading, Jesus has to be finite—not in order to redeem us from death but in order to be someone who can love and be loved. Recall here the extraordinary sequence in the Gospel of John, when Jesus on the cross says “I thirst,” is given to drink, then says “It is consummated” and dies, with a soldier subsequently thrusting a lance into his side, water and blood pouring out.87 The Christian move is to distinguish this body that is subject to need, dissolution, and decomposition from the “glorious” body of resurrection that is exempt from death. Yet the moment of consummation—of fulfillment of Scripture—is here the moment when the body of the beloved is shown to be a body of flesh and blood. If this body is “resurrected,” it is not because it ascends to heaven or is transformed into an incorruptible body, but because it is commemorated by those who love him, compelled to remember him precisely because he died and thereby allowing him to live on, in a process of communion that itself is subject to dissolution and death. ([Location 2840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2840))

---

> The death of the beloved is irrevocable—it is a loss that cannot be recuperated—since there is no life other than this life. From a Christian perspective, this is the most devastating scenario. “If there is no resurrection of the dead,” Paul writes in his First Letter to the Corinthians, “and if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain” (1 Cor. 15:13–14). Indeed, Paul emphasizes that “if for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied” (1 Cor. 15:19). If there is no life other than this life—a life that ends in death—then life is vain and futile, according to Paul. All that is left is to “eat and drink, for tomorrow we die” (1 Cor. 15:32). ([Location 2851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=2851))

---

> On the contrary, the peril of death is an intrinsic part of why it matters what we do and why it matters that we devote ourselves to someone or something living on beyond ourselves. We have to take care of one another because we can die, we have to fight for what we believe in because it lives only through our sustained effort, and we have to be concerned with what will be passed on to coming generations because the future is not certain. This is the double movement of secular faith. You run ahead into the risk of irrevocable death—you acknowledge that everything will be lost—and yet you are resolved to make the most of the time that is given.

---

> In The Brothers Karamazov, Dostoyevsky famously claimed that if God does not exist, then everything is permitted. But Fear and Trembling shows that the truth is the other way around. If there is a God for whom everything is possible, then anything can be permitted, even the killing of your own child for no reason other than God’s command. This is the truth that Kierkegaard forces you to confront. If you hold that your responsibility for Isaac is based on God’s command, then you are committed to killing Isaac if that turns out to be the command.

> These forms of purposive activity can become much more advanced in highly developed animals, but they are all forms of what I call natural freedom. Natural freedom provides a freedom of self-movement, but only in light of imperatives that are treated as given and ends that cannot be called into question by the agent itself. As distinct from natural freedom, spiritual freedom requires the ability to ask which imperatives to follow in light of our ends, as well as the ability to call into question, challenge, and transform our ends themselves.

---

> The difference between natural and spiritual freedom is not a matter of metaphysical substance, but a difference in the practical self-relation exhibited by human beings and other animals. Many kinds of animals exhibit forms of mourning, play, courage, deliberation, suffering, and joy. They may even in some cases (as studies of primates have shown) be able to experience a conflict of choice when certain instincts or loyalties are at odds with one another. Yet no other species we have encountered is capable of transforming its understanding of what it means to be that species. Changes in the environment can cause animal species—or certain members of species—to change patterns in their behavior, but the principles in light of which they act remain the same for as long as the species exist.

> In contrast, the understanding of what it means to be human—as manifested in the actual behavior of human beings—varies dramatically across history and across the world at any given moment of history. The difference between a monk who renounces filial bonds for an ascetic life in a monastery and a father who devotes his life to taking care of his children is not merely an individual difference in behavior. Rather, the two forms of life express radically different understandings of what it means to be human. The two men may not only have different degrees of courage, but what counts as courage for them is radically different. They may not only experience different degrees of grief and joy, but what counts as grief and joy for them is radically different. Even the experience of suffering is never merely a brute fact for us as human beings, but an experience we understand and respond to in light of what matters to us.

> There is no natural way for us to be and no species requirements that can exhaustively determine the principles in light of which we act.

> First, the distinction between natural and spiritual freedom is not a hierarchical distinction. That we are spiritually free does not make us inherently better than other animals, but it does mean that we are free in a qualitatively different sense. Because we can call into question the purposes of our own actions, we can hold ourselves to principles of justice, but we can also engage in forms of cruelty that go far beyond anything observed in other species. Second, the distinction between natural and spiritual freedom does not legitimize the exploitation of other animals. Many contemporary thinkers are critical of any distinction between humans and other animals, since they fear that such a distinction will serve to justify sexism or racism, as well as buttress the mistreatment of other species and the willful extraction of natural resources. Yet such “posthumanism” rests on a conflation of historical facts and philosophical arguments. As a matter of historical fact, it is true that a human/animal distinction often has been employed to classify certain genders or races as “subhuman” and to legitimize ruthless exploitation of the nonhuman world. The critique of such politics is well taken, as is the reminder that we too are animals and dependent on the fate of our environment. However, it does not follow from these facts that any distinction between humans and other animals is illegitimate or politically pernicious.

> Natural freedom has a single ought structure, since the agent cannot question its guiding principles and ask itself what it should do. Spiritual freedom, by contrast, is characterized by a double ought structure. As a spiritually free being, I can ask myself what I should do, since I am answerable not only for my actions but also for the normative principles that guide my actions. There are not only demands concerning what I ought to do; there is also the question if I ought to do what I supposedly ought to do.

> The third feature we can deduce is that there must be an asymmetrical relation of dependence between the living and the nonliving. Any form of animation necessarily has a relation to the inanimate (the prospect of its own death), but the inverse argument does not hold. Inanimate matter does not need any form of animation in order to exist. While the living cannot exist without a relation to nonliving matter, nonliving matter can exist without any relation to the living. This is why it is intelligible that a material universe can exist before there are any living beings and why it is intelligible that a material universe can remain after all forms of life are extinguished. The very existence of life is a fragile and destructible phenomenon. ([Location 3088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3088))

> These features of the concept of life make any life intelligible as a life. To be alive is a formally distinctive way of being an entity, which is characterized by the self-maintaining activity of a fragile material being. The concept of life has two genera, which I call natural life and spiritual life. In keeping with the concept of life itself, the genera of life are defined not in terms of material substances or material properties but in terms of two different forms of life-activities.

> The first trait of natural freedom is the activity of self-reproduction. Any form of natural life is acting for the sake of self-preservation or the preservation of the species and thereby exhibits a fundamental form of self-determination. The continuous reproduction of the individual organism across a lifetime, as well as its possible replication or procreation in the form of other individuals, are expressions of the natural freedom of self-determination.

> There is a vast difference between a plant that can replicate merely by disseminating its seeds, or an insect that necessarily dies in the act of copulation, and an animal that can survive its own act of procreation to live on with its descendants. The latter has a greater capacity for self-determination, since it can care for its own progeny and recognize itself in a generational chain, rather than being immediately subsumed by the reproduction of the species. Yet all these forms of life remain within the bounds of natural freedom, insofar as they cannot call into question the purpose of procreation and cannot transform the given ends of generational life.

---

> The second trait of natural freedom is the ability of a living being to bear a negative self-relation. When faced with adversity, a living being does not passively submit to what happens but engages in some form of active resistance in accordance with its own self-determination. Even in disease or other forms of internal rupture, a living being is not simply negated but maintains itself in the negative experience of suffering. ([Location 3117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3117))

---

> The third trait of natural freedom is the relation to a surplus of time. The striving self-maintenance of a living being necessarily generates more lifetime than is required to secure the means of survival, so there is at least a minimal amount of “free time” for every living being. The capacity to engage with free time is of course something that varies greatly among different species of natural life. Even a simple plant generates free time in itself, since it does not necessarily have to devote all its time to absorbing the light, water, and other forms of nourishment that are needed for its sustenance.

> The first trait of spiritual freedom is that the purposes of life are treated as normative rather than as natural. As a spiritual being, I am acting not simply for the sake of preserving my life or the life of my species but for the sake of who I take myself to be. Who I take myself to be is a practical identity because it requires that I keep faith with a commitment. For example, if I have a life-defining commitment to a political cause, I take my life to be worth living because I am a political activist. My practical identity gives me a standard of integrity (a norm) in relation to which I understand myself as succeeding or failing to be myself.

---

> The order of priority among a person’s practical identities is what I call her “existential identity.” A person’s existential identity consists in how she prioritizes her practical identities and responds to conflicts between their respective demands. My existential identity—what it means to be “Martin”—is not an additional practical identity, but the constitutive practical activity of striving to hold together an order of priority between my practical identities. In terms of Neurath’s boat, my practical identities are different planks and my existential identity is the boat that holds the planks together in a fragile form. To be someone and do something, I cannot merely have a number of practical identities. There must be a principle of unity—being Martin—that renders my practical identities intelligible as mine and gives them an order of priority in my life.

> The second trait of spiritual freedom is the ability of a person to bear a negative self-relation. The negative self-relation may be expressed as a crisis of existential identity—a conflict or breakdown in the relation among my different practical identities—but it also lives within any given practical identity.

> Betraying my integrity may in some cases be a fate worse than death, but it is not the same as death. If it were, I would not have to experience the pain of failure, since I would be dead. When I experience the pain of failing to be myself it is rather because I am still alive and trying to lead my life. This is my ability to bear a negative self-relation. Because my identity is practical (a matter of what I do), it can fail or break down. Even the established order of priority among my practical identities—my existential identity—can break down. Planks that hold my boat together can break or fall apart, leaving me shipwrecked. The breakdown of my established integrity, however, is not the end of my life as a person. If I experience the disintegration of the boat, I have not yet drowned and am still trying to hold it together. Being a failed person is still being a person. ([Location 3193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3193))

---

> Likewise, being a person is not necessarily to succeed in sustaining an existential identity but consists in trying to sustain or to transform my existential identity. When I fail to be the person I am trying to be—when I am shipwrecked—I am not simply negated but the subject of the negative experience of failing to be myself. This possibility of failure is a necessary boundary condition for any practical and existential identity. The prospects of failing to be myself—of losing my integrity, losing my boat, losing my life by drowning—remind me why it matters that I have integrity and that I lead my life.

> The ability to bear a negative self-relation makes it possible for me to strive to live up to the demands of a practical and existential identity, even at the expense of great personal suffering.

---

> Striving to be who I take myself to be is not a task that can be completed or a goal that can be achieved.

---

> The third trait of spiritual freedom is the ability to ask myself what to do with my time. Like all living beings, I have a surplus of time, but as a spiritual being my relation to the surplus of time is inseparable from the question of how I should spend my time. This is the question that underlies all normative considerations, since what I do with my time is what I do with my life. Every question of what I ought to do—or ought not to do—is ultimately a question of what I ought to do with my time.

Neither social norms nor natural instincts, however, can by themselves determine what I do. ([Location 3301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3301))

> Secular faith and secular reason are therefore two sides of the same coin. Secular faith has nothing to do with religious revelation or mystical intuition, but is inherent in the structure of a normative commitment. I must keep faith with my commitment as normative—as something to which I am bound—since it only lives in and through me. I can come to question, transform, or betray my commitment, but only in terms of a different commitment with which I keep faith.

> My death is therefore the necessary horizon of my life. In spatial terms, the horizon is a condition of possibility for anything to be visible at all. Everything I see, I see against a horizon, which makes it possible to distinguish between proximity and distance: to distinguish between what is close and what is far away. The horizon allows me to discern spatial relations, but the horizon is not itself located at any point in space. No matter how far I walk, I will never arrive at the horizon, since the horizon moves with me. ([Location 3364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3364))

> We can wake up in the middle of the night, asking ourselves what we are doing with our lives. What used to be utterly meaningful can lose its grip and what we do can cease to make sense to us. These forms of existential anxiety can be paralyzing (as in boredom or depression), but they can also transform, change, and reinvigorate our commitments. Existential anxiety is a sign of our spiritual freedom. It is because our fundamental commitments are not given that we can bind ourselves to an ideal rather than a natural purpose. Moreover, it is because our fundamental commitments are trembling and may fall apart that we can even engage the question of what to do with our lives.

> Yet the aim of religious faith is to eliminate spiritual freedom in favor of eternal salvation.

This is a secular model of morality, where the child is taught responsibility on the basis of her own freedom and sense of finitude. In contrast, the second child refrains from touching the artwork because she fears punishment and hopes for a reward.

Study

---

> The greatest resources for developing a secular notion of freedom can be found in the writings of Karl Marx. This may be surprising, since Marxism is notorious for having given rise to totalitarian regimes in the twentieth century. Yet, as I will seek to show, there is no support in Marx’s thinking for any form of totalitarian state. On the contrary, the premise for all of his work is “the existence of living human individuals”1 as ends in themselves. This commitment to individual freedom—what Marx describes as “the free development of individualities”2—is the foundation for his critique of capitalism and his critique of religion. ([Location 3557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3557))

> The starting point for Marx is what it means that we are living beings. ([Location 3563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3563))

---

> What Marx calls the realm of freedom is opened up by the capacity of living beings to generate more lifetime than is required to secure the means of survival. ([Location 3568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3568))

---

> As Marx emphasizes, however, human beings are the only animals who can relate to their activity as a free activity. Other animals are identical with their life-activity, in the sense that they cannot call into question the purpose of what they are doing. Human beings, on the contrary, can transform the purpose of their life-activity. Rather than treat our own survival and the survival of our species as the given end (as the ultimate purpose of our life-activity), we can treat survival as a means toward the end of leading a free, spiritual life. For the same reason, the question of what should count as a satisfying, successful form of life is never finally settled for us. ([Location 3571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3571))

---

> The ability to engage our life-activity as a free activity is what the young Marx calls the “species-being” (Gattungswesen) of human beings.3 The notion of species-being has often been dismissed as a naive appeal to a supposed human nature or human essence, but such a critique is misleading. The species-being of the human is precisely that we have no given nature or essence. To be sure, Marx holds that labor is a necessary feature of human beings, but for Marx labor does not specify any essential content that would define us once and for all. Rather, “labor” is his term for all forms of purposive activity. Ranging from the most instrumental action to the most elevated spiritual pursuits, labor can be individual and collective, artisanal and artistic, political and philosophical. Labor may be driven by physical need, but it can also be motivated by creative aspirations and communal commitments. While Marx is highly critical of all forms of coerced labor—whether slavery, serfdom, or wage labor—emancipation is a matter of not only being free from work but also of being free to work in light of the ends that matter to us.

---

> Analyses of value and economy must therefore be understood in light of the finitude of time. Any economy is ultimately an “economy of time,” Marx writes in his Grundrisse, since any form of “activity depends on economization of time.”6 This is the argument that I seek to ground on the deepest level. To grasp the stakes and implications of the economy of time, we must proceed from the conditions of intelligibility for spiritual life, which are implicit in Marx’s account but that he himself does not explicitly recognize as such. ([Location 3620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3620))

---

> Marx’s analysis of economy can be seen to operate on three levels. ([Location 3625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3625))

---

> The first level is what Marx calls the level of appearance. All economies must appear in some form, and the form of appearance is price. In capitalist economies, price has many forms of appearance—wages are the price paid by the capitalist, profit is the price paid by the worker and consumer, rent is the price paid by the leaser of property, and so on. Even a noncapitalist economy, however, must appear through some form of price. An economy is not intelligible unless there is a cost of production, which means that there must be a price to pay for both parties in an economic transaction. If it did not cost me anything to provide you with something, it would not be intelligible that any price is involved in our transaction. Even when I give you something for free, the mere act of giving it to you must involve a cost for me—if only the cost of the time it takes me to give it to you. My act would not be intelligible as a gift unless giving it entailed a cost for me and just by virtue of recognizing it as a gift you become indebted, even if neither one of us insists on the debt.

Hmm cf with gifts and mutual aid

---

> The measure of value is the second level of Marx’s analysis, which he calls the level of essence. The measure of value is essential, since it determines how we calculate growth in an economy and thereby how we measure the overall wealth in a society. An economy does not grow because there is more money circulating—on the contrary, an economy can be shrinking when there is more money circulating than previously—but because there is an overall increase of value in the economy. The measure of value, then, is the essence of any economy. ([Location 3639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3639))

---

> For Marx, however, the essence of an economical system—the measure of value—is itself something that can change historically. We can change the essence of our economy (our measure of value) and thereby also change the form in which our economic relations appear. How we organize our economy and how we measure the value of our time are open to historical transformation. ([Location 3644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3644))

---

> The third level of Marx’s analysis is therefore concerned with the transhistorical conditions for any economy. Transhistorical conditions are not beyond history but rather a feature of every historical epoch. How we organize our lives into an economy of time is historically specific, but that we have to organize our lives into an economy of time is a condition for any form of society. Likewise, how we organize our social relations and how we relate to our embodiment is historically specific, but that we are social beings and that we are embodied are general features of spiritual life. In short, how we exist is historically specific, but that we exist as historical beings—finite, embodied, and social—is a condition for every moment of history. There has never been and there will never be a historical epoch that does not require some form of economy of time, some form of labor, some form of social relations, some mode of producing and reproducing life.

> There are many things I believe are valuable, but only a few things that I am valuing in the sense of making them a priority in my life. For example, I believe that the discipline of medicine is highly valuable, but it is not a priority in my life to be a doctor. By contrast, in valuing the life of my child—even and especially because the life of my child is invaluable to me—I am not merely avowing a belief. I am expressing a commitment to which I hold myself and that places demands on me. ([Location 3689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3689))

> To value someone or something is to put myself at stake in what happens to what I value. By virtue of my commitment, I cannot be indifferent but must be responsive to the fate of what I value. Even when I believe that something is valuable without being directly involved with it—e.g., the discipline of medicine—I have to be willing to do something on its behalf. Indeed, if the discipline of medicine were threatened, I would be compelled to do what I can to save it. If I am not willing to do or say anything to defend the discipline of medicine, I do not actually believe that it is valuable.

If I could reduce the necessary labor time by having running water in my house, I would do so.

---

> How we distinguish between the realm of necessity and the realm of freedom is never settled once and for all, but we have to make the distinction for there to be a question of freedom in our lives. If I treated all my activities merely as means—if nothing I did counted as valuable in itself for me—I could not lead a life, since my life would have no purpose internal to its own activities. Inversely, if I treated everything I do as valuable in itself, I could not lead a life either, since whatever I do would be an essential part of the purpose of my life and there would be no question of what I ought to do with my life.

---

> The correlation between labor time and value holds for all the objects I produce or acquire in the realm of necessity. The time I spend on securing the objects I need is not valuable in itself, so their value is determined by how much lifetime it costs me to generate and maintain them for consumption. ([Location 3735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3735))

---

> The preferred form of labor in the realm of necessity is therefore what Marx calls “dead labor.” Dead labor designates work that is already done and stored up for future use. A bottle of water that I have brought back from the well contains a certain amount of completed (“dead”) labor, and its value is determined accordingly. More generally, the practical know-how that I have acquired through repeated practice is a form of objectified, past labor that I can draw on without having to start from the beginning every time I have to do something. Most importantly for Marx, all kinds of material technologies are forms of dead labor, since technologies allow us to get things done more efficiently while reducing the amount of living labor involved in the process. ([Location 3737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3737))

---

> The rational aim, then, is to reduce the realm of necessity and increase the realm of freedom. The less time we must devote to activities that are merely means to an end, the more time we can devote to activities that for us are ends in themselves. What those activities are is not a given, and part of living in the realm of freedom is having time to develop or transform our conceptions of what makes life worth living. In the realm of freedom my activities are ends in themselves—including the activity of interrogating what should count as an end in itself—since I pursue the activities on the basis of my commitments rather than because of material need or coercion. ([Location 3744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3744))

---

> The measure of value is thus different in the realm of freedom than in the realm of necessity. The value of an object or an activity in the realm of freedom is not directly correlated with the amount of labor time required to produce or maintain it. Rather, the value of an object or an activity depends on my normative commitments. ([Location 3748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3748))

---

> For the same reason, the time we spend in the realm of freedom is not normatively understood as a negative “cost” for which we should be compensated. Rather, spending time in the realm of freedom is a value in and for itself. In the realm of freedom, value is not measured by accumulated, dead labor time but by how much time we have to lead our lives. The more free time we have to pursue the activities that matter to us, the wealthier we are. ([Location 3755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3755))

> Classical liberal theories that are committed merely to a formal or legal notion of freedom—a mere right to freedom—have long been criticized for depriving the idea of freedom of any real content. My legal right to liberty is of little value if I do not have the means to lead my life and make use of my freedom. These means include an education that opens me to a range of possible ways of leading my life, as well as sufficient material resources to reduce the time I have to spend on securing my survival and allow me time to engage the question of what I should do with my freedom. As the liberal philosopher Isaiah Berlin points out, the value of freedom depends on “adequate conditions for the use of freedom.” ([Location 3823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3823))

> Marx regards the basic social form that provides the framework for all liberal reflections on freedom—capitalism—as itself inimical to the actualization of freedom. Liberal theories may advocate various forms of restrictions on capitalism, but they never call into question the social form of capitalism itself. In contrast, Marx argues that the commitment to freedom is betrayed by the social organization and division of labor that is enforced by capitalism. Most fundamentally—I will show—the measure of value and social wealth under capitalism directly contradicts the value of free time.

> Hegel’s radical philosophical claim is that the Idea of freedom is inseparable from material and social practices. The Idea of freedom is not abstract but must be embodied in concrete institutional practices in order to be an Idea of freedom. To use Hegel’s favorite word, the Idea of freedom must be wirklich—actual, real, effective, at work—which requires that we sustain institutions that recognize the freedom of everyone to lead their own lives.

> Our practical identities are inseparable from the society to which we belong. If we live and work in a society in which the dominant way of relating to one another is to compete for resources, we will understand ourselves primarily as creatures who are competing for resources. Our apparently natural egoism is itself a matter of our social formation. If we see ourselves as atomistic individuals who form an aggregate in society—with each of us driven to pursue an egoistic end—it is not because we are an aggregate of atomistic individuals as a matter of natural fact, but because we are socialized into a world where we treat and acknowledge one another as though we were atomistic individuals who are naturally driven to pursue an egoistic end.

> For Hegel, an actual free society is one in which we can recognize our commitment to the common good as the condition of possibility for our own freedom. Rather than seeing the laws of the state as imposed on us and as coercively restricting our self-interest, we should be able to see ourselves as bound to the laws of the state by virtue of our own commitment to lead a free life, which requires that the laws of the state in turn are seen as contestable and transformable by us. This mutual recognition of the state and the individual is the condition for actual freedom. As Hegel emphasizes, “the Idea of freedom is truly present only as the state.” ([Location 3889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3889))

> For the same reason, the institutional formation of freedom is not a matter of imposing externally motivated laws and rules on subjects in order to make them obedient citizens. On the contrary, it is matter of providing forms of education—and other institutional practices—that enable persons to be citizens who can understand the norms to which they are subjected as ones to which they have bound themselves; to be citizens who are internally motivated in their actions and who can justify what they are doing to themselves as well as to others.

> The question, then, is whether the modern state and the market economy on which it depends are compatible with an “actual” (wirklich) free society. This is the critical question that Marx poses to Hegel, but it has to be posed in the right way. Marx’s own critique of Hegel is not as powerful as it could be, since he does not grasp Hegel’s philosophical logic. Marx assumes that Hegel is imposing an “abstract” Idea of freedom on society in order to justify the state protection of capitalist property rights and the exploitation of wage labor.

> “The livelihood and welfare of individuals should be secured,” Hegel emphasizes, “i.e. particular welfare should be treated as a right and duly actualized.”18 Particular welfare is here not merely a matter of basic sustenance, but of having the social possibilities to lead a free life that can be recognized as dignified by oneself and by those whom one recognizes in turn. The commitment to the welfare and dignity of each citizen is contradicted, however, by the dynamic of wage labor that is the condition for producing social wealth under capitalism. As Hegel points out, the market economy of civil society can provide only two possible solutions to the problem of poverty and unemployment, with both solutions being fundamentally unsatisfactory.

> On the one hand, the poor can be supported by charity or public welfare provisions, but this is ultimately inadequate, since it does not allow for the social recognition of having a meaningful profession through which one contributes to one’s own well-being and to the common good of the society to which one belongs. On the other hand, the livelihood of the poor can be provided by the creation of more paid employment—more wage labor—“which would increase the volume of production” in civil society.20 Yet, as Hegel perceptively observes, “it is precisely in overproduction and the lack of a proportionate number of consumers who are themselves productive that the evil consists, and this is merely exacerbated by the two expedients in question.” ([Location 3950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=3950))

---

> Marx’s critique of capitalism is therefore best understood as motivated by a commitment to making the Idea of freedom actual.25 The comparison between wage labor and slavery, which Marx often invokes, is illuminating here. As Hegel was well aware in his own time, the professed commitment to the Idea of freedom (“all are free”) did not prevent allegedly democratic states from maintaining the institution of slavery. The crucial point for Hegel, however, was that the historical achievement of the Idea of freedom made it possible to recognize slavery as a contradictory and self-undermining social form, which must be overcome for us to be true to our Idea of who we are. Likewise, Marx argues that wage labor is a contradictory and self-undermining social form, which must be overcome for us to achieve actual freedom and equality.

---

> There are many who would respond by saying that our economic and social life simply could not function without wage labor. One should remember, however, that the same argument used to be made with regard to slavery. Even many prominent thinkers who acknowledged negative and regrettable aspects of slavery still held the institution of slavery to be a necessity, without which a free society would fall apart. The idea that the enslavement of some is necessary for the freedom of others could only be overcome by disclosing—from within a historical form of life—other possibilities of living and working together.

> In principle we are all equal under capitalism, in the sense that no one has a given right to dominate anyone else.

> Second, each participant in an economic relation under capitalism is formally recognized as free.

If I own means of production, I can employ you for a wage and make a profit that in turn increases my capital. Whereas if you do not own means of production, you have no choice but to sell your labor time either to me or to some other capitalist (unless you “choose” not to live at all). While you are formally recognized as free, you are effectively forced to labor for the sake of someone else’s profit in order to survive. Instead of religion or nature, economic relations now serve as the justification for the subordination of one person by another.

> The general form of a commodity is not specific to capitalism, but pertains to anything that has both a use value and an exchange value. The use value of a commodity is the purpose it serves, which means that a commodity can have multiple use values. The use value of a gallon of water, for example, can be to replenish someone who is thirsty, clean someone who is dirty, wash clothes or dishes, grow vegetables, and so on. The exchange value of a gallon of water, however, is not concerned with its specific use value but is determined by a comparison to the value of other commodities. ([Location 4028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4028))

---

> The profound question is how to understand the measure of value in exchange value. As Marx reminds us in Capital, Aristotle was the first to raise this question in a rigorous form. “There can be no exchange,” Aristotle points out, “without equality, and no equality without commensurability.”28 To exchange a gallon of water for a pair of shoes we must be able to compare their value, even though a gallon of water is incomparable to a pair of shoes. Aristotle himself concedes that he cannot see how there can be a real basis for such a comparison. “In reality, it is impossible,” he asserts, “that such unlike things can be commensurable,” so he reduces the measure of exchange value to “a makeshift for practical purposes.”29 In contrast, Marx emphasizes that there is a real measure of value for exchange value, namely, labor time. The one thing that all commodities have in common—and that makes it possible to compare their value—is that they cost labor time to produce.

---

> According to Marx, Aristotle was unable to grasp the measure of value in exchange value because he lived in a society that was founded on slave labor. A commodity produced by a slave is not recognized as having “cost” labor time, since the slave is not granted any ownership of his time. The general value of labor time can be recognized only in a society where each participant in the process of exchange—and each producer of a commodity—is held to be equal. ([Location 4049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4049))

---

> This is one of many passages where Marx makes clear that his own insights would not be possible without the historical emergence of capitalist economic relations and the notion of equality that is intertwined with them. Even before capitalism, labor time was implicitly the measure of value in exchange—otherwise it would be impossible to compare the “cost” of two different commodities—but only with the advent of capitalism is labor time explicitly the measure of value in exchange. The latter transformation requires not only that each person be recognized as equal but also that each person be recognized as free to spend her own time. Only the recognition that we have free time—and that our free time is inherently valuable for us—can make our labor intelligible as a cost and bestow value on the products of our labor. This is one of my central arguments, which is merely implied by Marx’s analysis but required for it to make sense. The social form that recognizes the general right to free time under capitalism is wage labor. The institution of wage labor acknowledges that when I work for my subsistence I am operating in a realm of necessity, where my labor counts as a negative “cost” for which I am compensated with a wage. By the same token, it is acknowledged that wage labor is a means for the end of leading my life in a realm of freedom that opens up beyond my working hours. My wage is literally a means for my subsistence, which is supposed to give me free time to pursue the projects and commitments that matter to me (otherwise there would be no institutional difference between wage labor and slavery). Yet, as Marx maintains, the promise of freedom through wage labor is necessarily betrayed by the social form of wage labor itself. ([Location 4060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4060))

---

> The cost of producing labor-power is therefore inseparable from the cost of reproducing the life of the worker, granting him enough food, sleep, and other means of subsistence to ensure that he can continue to labor. This is why the rate of wages is essentially related to the average cost for the means of subsistence in a society at a given time. For capitalism to reproduce itself day after day, it must provide the means for workers to reproduce themselves, so that they can generate both their own labor-power for tomorrow and children who can become workers the day after tomorrow. As Marx explains: “The labor-power withdrawn from the market by wear and tear, and by death, must continually be replaced by, at the very least, an equal amount of fresh labor-power. Hence the sum of the means of subsistence necessary for the production of labor-power must include the means necessary for the worker’s replacements, i.e., his children.” ([Location 4101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4101))

---

> The investment in labor-power is generally a profitable investment because living beings generate more lifetime—and therefore more labor-power—than it costs to maintain them. This is the origin of the surplus value that is transformed into capital. The value that the average worker can produce in an hour of labor is greater than the cost of maintaining the life of the average worker for an hour of labor. How much greater the value is relative to the cost depends on numerous factors, but that the value produced by labor is greater than the cost of labor is necessary for there to be an increase of wealth in capitalist economies. Even after all the additional costs of production and retail have been factored in, there must be a surplus value that is generated by the activity of living labor—otherwise there would be no overall profit in the system, no “growth” in the economy. Moreover, the surplus cannot go back to the worker himself but must be reinvested and accumulated as capital by the owner of the means of production.

> The value of a gallon of water is not determined by the quantity of time it takes for you as a particular worker to produce it, but by the quantity of time it takes for the average worker under current societal conditions of production (the socially necessary labor time), which in our case is one hour for one gallon of water. If it takes you more time than the socially necessary labor time to deliver a gallon of water (if you are slower than the average worker), my profit decreases and may even dwindle away altogether. Inversely, if it takes you less time than the socially necessary labor time (if you are faster than the average worker), my profit increases and I can stay in business.

> The reason that I am driven—as a capitalist employer—to press more labor out of my workers is therefore not primarily a matter of psychology or individual vice. Before Marx, socialist writers tended to portray capitalists as evil villains who exploit workers out of greed, as though the problem were one of morality. In contrast, Marx shows that the dynamic of exploitation is intrinsic to the social form of capitalism itself and not reducible to individual vice or virtue.

As an individual consumer, I can choose not to buy certain products, but without a collective transformation of the system of exchange I will continue to participate in capitalist exploitation. Likewise, as a capitalist employer, I will go out of business and find myself consigned to wage labor if I do not extract surplus value from my workers. As a wage laborer, finally, I have no choice but to submit to a capitalist employer if I want to make a living and survive.

> Relative surplus value concerns the difference between the wage I have to pay my workers for one hour of labor and the value my workers can produce during one hour of labor.

> When my workers produce a gallon of water twice as fast thanks to a new technology, the value of a gallon is reduced by half. To produce the same amount of value, my workers are now producing twice as much water during one hour of labor. As a consequence, a gallon of water is cheaper to buy in the village. The average cost of living for my workers is decreased and their wages lowered (or at least limited in their increase) while still allowing them to attain their necessary means of subsistence.

The workers who lose their jobs join an increasing surplus population that has to move between temporary employments and accept lower wages to make a living at all.

For Smith and Ricardo, labor as the essential measure of value is a transhistorical fact. They assume that labor has always been and will always be the source of social wealth. For Marx, by contrast, socially necessary labor time as the measure of value is specific to the commodity form and becomes the essence of value only in the capitalist mode of production. Labor time as the measure of value is not transhistorically necessary but the historically specific essence of capitalism, which is contradictory and can be overcome.

If we did not generate a surplus of lifetime we would have no labor-power to sell—since all our time would be consumed by the activity of merely staying alive—and nothing could be gained from employing us. Inversely, because we continually generate a surplus of time, a capitalist employer can in principle extract a surplus value by purchasing our labor-power for a wage. For the surplus value of our labor to be converted into profit, however, we must not only produce but also consume commodities, not only sell our labor-power but also buy the products of labor for more than it cost to produce them.

> As long as we live under capitalism, the hyper-well in our village cannot generate any value for us by virtue of its own operation. The only way we can extract value from the well is by extracting surplus value from a person who has to operate the well in order to make a living. This is a direct consequence of measuring value in terms of labor time. If the quantity of labor time determines our wealth, then a machine that reduces the labor time reduces our wealth—unless we make up for the decrease in necessary labor time by increasing the amount of surplus labor time for the worker. The exploitation of workers is necessary under capitalism, since only the extraction of surplus value can generate any form of social wealth.

Capitalism is therefore bound to increase the realm of necessity and decrease the realm of freedom.

> Indeed, Marx underlines that capitalism “creates the material means and the nucleus for relations,” which could lead to “a higher form of society, with a greater reduction of the overall time devoted to material labor.”40 By demonstrating that we can dramatically reduce socially necessary labor time, the technological advances achieved under capitalism could contribute to an expansion of “the true realm of freedom, the development of human abilities as an end in itself.”41 Nevertheless, under capitalism we cannot directly devote ourselves to an expansion of the realm of freedom, since there is no other measure of social wealth than the surplus value extracted from living labor. No matter how advanced our technological capacities for production become, capitalism must continue “to use labor time as the measuring rod for the giant social forces thereby created,”42 since there is no other source for the growth of capital than the surplus time of living labor.

---

> As long as we measure our social wealth in terms of labor time, technological development is bound to intensify exploitative methods for extracting relative surplus value from workers. Due to increased technological efficiency in the process of production, workers either become unemployed and part of an army of surplus labor whose presence can be used to keep down wages (as tends to happen in the Western world today), or they become subjected to extremely cruel working conditions that are designed to extract as much surplus value as possible from their labor (as tends to happen in the parts of the world where we now locate most of our manufacturing).

> the contradiction of capital bears an emancipatory potential within itself. The more advanced our technological powers of production become, the more manifest it becomes that labor time is an inadequate measure for social wealth. When the process of production is increasingly automated and the need for living labor reduced, “the human being comes to relate more as a watchman and regulator to the production process itself.”43 This is potentially emancipatory, since it can lead us to develop ourselves as “social individuals.” For us to become truly social individuals in Marx’s sense, we have to be the subjects of production—planning and directing it for our purposes—rather than being subjected to production for the sake of capital. “In this transformation,” Marx writes, “what appears as the great foundation of production and wealth is neither the immediate labor performed by the worker nor the time that he works, but rather the appropriation (Aneignung) of his own general productive power, his understanding of nature and his mastery over it by virtue of his existence as a social body—in a word, the development of the social individual.”44 ([Location 4442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4442))

> Strikingly, Marx uses the English term disposable time in italics in the original (rather than the German verfügbare Zeit). The social transformation that Marx advocates requires the revaluation of value. “It is no longer,” Marx emphasizes, “labor time that is the measure of wealth, but rather disposable time.”47 What Marx here describes as disposable time is what I call socially available free time.

> Capitalism thus creates the material conditions that make it possible to “blow up”51—in die Luft zu sprengen—its own foundation. Yet, in the Grundrisse, Marx elides the question of what is required of us to make use of this explosive power in an enabling rather than disabling way. He merely emphasizes that “the theft of alien labor time, on which the present wealth is based, appears as a miserable foundation in face of this new one, created by large-scale industry itself. As soon as labor in its direct form has ceased to be the great source of wealth, labor time ceases and must cease to be its measure.”52 ([Location 4471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4471))

---

> Labor time should therefore cease to be the measure of social wealth, but whether or not it will cease to be the measure of wealth depends on whether we pursue a collective transformation of our conception of value. To say that labor time must cease to be the measure of wealth can either be read as the statement of an inevitable necessity (i.e., the dynamic of capitalism automatically leads to its own overcoming) or as an injunction to us—stating that we must revalue our conception of value.

If the overcoming of capitalism is historically inevitable, then Marx’s own analysis is unnecessary, since the dynamic of material forces alone will secure the overcoming of capitalism, independently of what we are committed to, what we value, and what we understand about the world in which we live. Inversely, the revaluation of value requires not only a theoretical but also a practical transformation of the way we reproduce our lives.

To recall, there can be no spiritual life without some form of the state: some form of institutional organization of our life-activities governed by norms to which we have bound ourselves. As spiritually free beings, we have always lived and will always live in a state. There is not first a free individual who is then formed by a state. From the beginning, our freedom is formed by some kind of state—some kind of collective self-legislation—since we can make sense of who we are only in terms of socially instituted norms.

> The means required for a revolution depends on the historical situation, and Marx himself emphasizes that a revolution achieved through “peaceful means” of democracy is preferable to a violent one.54 In either event, the end—the purpose—of a revolution that emancipates us from capitalism must be the revaluation of value, which requires new institutional forms. Marx rightly calls for the overcoming of the state as a social form that maintains a capitalist division of classes. However, such a conception of the state is not its defining form (as Marx sometimes tends to assume). Rather, the state as an organ of competing class interests is a historically specific conception of the state, which can be overcome through the overcoming of capitalism. For life after capitalism to have any determinate form, we must reinvent rather than abolish the form of the state. As I have argued, the state as an institutional form of our lives—which can comprise a plurality of institutions—is not itself something that can be eliminated, since it is a condition for spiritual freedom to be possible.

---

> As Marx rightly underlines, “freedom consists in converting the state from an organ superimposed upon society into one completely subordinate to it.”56 To subordinate the state to society is to transform the state into an actual democracy. “All forms of states have democracy as their truth,” Marx writes, “and therefore they are untrue inasmuch as they are not democracies.”57 Emancipated forms of the state are thus required for what I call democratic socialism. Moreover, since capitalism is global, the overcoming of capitalism ultimately requires a global alliance of democratic socialist states.

> Actual democracy requires that our political debates and deliberations—as well as our forms of political representation—are based on competing conceptions of how best to serve the interests of society as a whole, rather than on competing private interests that are put forth in the name of society as a whole. For the same reason, actual democracy requires that our society is organized in such a way that there does not have to be an antagonism between serving our own interests and serving the interests of society as a whole. While the commitment to serve the interests of society as a whole will always be challenging and contestable, it is in principle impossible to sustain such a commitment under capitalism. Because of the social form of wage labor, democratic politics and democratic states necessarily serve as organs for representing class interests that are competing for control. We cannot actually deliberate on how best to serve the interests of society as a whole, since we must prioritize the private interests of capitalists. This prioritization is not optional, since under capitalism there can be no production of social wealth without the profits of privately owned enterprises.

> For Marx, however, civil rights are not sufficient for actual democracy. For political democracy to be actual—for us to actually be able to negotiate the form of our life together—the purpose and practice of our economy must itself be a matter of our democratic deliberation. This is why capitalism and actual democracy are incompatible. Under capitalism, the purpose of our economic production is already decided. What matters above all is to generate a “growth” of capital in the economy. This purpose is beyond democratic discussion, since it is built into how we measure our social wealth in the first place. We may discuss democratically how we should distribute our wealth, but how much wealth we have to distribute is determined by the growth of capital we are able to sustain in our economy.

> Even when the necessary labor time in our society is reduced thanks to technological innovations, we cannot democratically decide which forms of labor should be available to pursue in our expanded realm of freedom. We cannot create new occupations on the basis of what would be important and meaningful to do for ourselves and for our society, but must find occupations that are profitable on the market, since only such occupations generate a growth of value in the economy. In effect, our social wealth under capitalism is not measured by actual productivity and surplus time. Rather, we are forced to measure our social wealth in terms of the surplus value we extract from the exploitation of living labor and transform into capital growth.

> Socialism is thereby reduced to a mode of political administration and economic distribution, which leaves the mode of production and the measure of value intact. This is exactly what happened in the Soviet Union, which managed to betray all of Marx’s fundamental insights. The Soviet legislation under Stalin literally changed the formulation of Marx’s core principle (“from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs”) to the following: “from each according to his ability, to each according to his labor.” It is hard to imagine a greater distortion of Marx’s thought. As soon as the satisfaction of our needs depends on the contribution of our labor, we are back to the form of coercion that Marx sought to overcome through his critique of wage labor. Under Stalinism, the state effectively becomes one giant capitalist that wields its power over the citizens by forcing them to do proletarian labor in order to survive.

> On the one hand, technology should not be seen as something that alienates us from a natural form of labor or a primitive communism. All such forms of nostalgia are misguided and ignore Marx’s fundamental insight that the commitment to social freedom for all became possible because of the historical advent of capitalism. There has never been a natural form of labor for spiritual beings and a primitive communism is neither possible nor desirable. The labor of spiritual beings is from the beginning a matter of technology (some form of tools), and the overcoming of capitalism requires the further development of technology rather than its rejection. On the other hand, capitalism cannot be overcome through a linear continuation of the same mode of production, accompanied merely by a redistribution of the wealth generated by proletarian labor. The aim is not to glorify proletarian labor but to overcome it. The overcoming of proletarian labor requires a transformation of the mode of production itself, which should be based on the power of dead labor rather than on the value of living labor. Technological advances entail that more and more of the production time that is required for our goods can be separated from the labor time of living beings.

> Material forces of production cannot by themselves transform the measure of value that shapes our conception of social wealth. If our machines will be different it is not only because our technological abilities will be different, but because we will design the machines for a different purpose. A difference in purpose is a normative difference, which cannot be reduced to material conditions, since machines cannot by themselves determine the purpose of their production. The purpose of production is intelligible only in light of a measure of value that cannot be derived from the machines themselves. Thus, our normative purpose necessarily informs how we reproduce our material conditions. For example, under capitalism many of our technological devices are designed to break sooner rather than later, since it is more profitable for the producer if we are forced to buy a new device. Our technological know-how is not developed and employed in service of the practical purposes of our lives, but in service of maximizing profit. Under democratic socialism, by contrast, our research into new forms of technology, our designs of actual machines, and our actual process of production will all be different because we are producing for the sake of increasing socially available free time rather than for the sake of generating profit.

> The point of leading a free life—both individually and collectively—is not to transcend the realm of necessity but to be able to negotiate its relation to the realm of freedom. No matter how productive dead labor may become, it will always require at least the living labor of our planning the purposes and directing the operations of technology. Furthermore, the value of dead labor itself depends on our normative commitments. It is far from given that we will want to replace living labor with dead labor as much as possible and in all areas of necessary social labor. For example, even if we could design machines to take care of the sick and the elderly, we may hold that there is an intrinsic value in having care provided by other beings who care and who can understand suffering. The principle “from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs” is not the imposition of an anonymous collective will, but the condition of possibility for genuinely democratic deliberations regarding what matters to us and how we should care for one another.

First, the reduction of socially necessary labor time through technological innovation necessarily leads to unemployment, since fewer workers are required in the process of production. Second, the unemployed have to accept less pay to find a temporary job and thereby allow capitalists to keep down the general level of wages. Third, the surplus population of the unemployed is highly useful for the irregular rhythms of capitalist production, since the unemployed are available for employment when an increase of production is profitable and can be dispensed with when production needs to be decreased for the sake of capital gain.

What I call social democracy comprises any form of socialism or Marxism that limits itself to redistribution and does not grapple with the fundamental question of value in the mode of production. Democratic socialism, by contrast, requires a fundamental and practical revaluation of the capitalist measure of value.

> During the twentieth century, social democracy developed into a “soft” form of capitalism, whose crowning achievement was the welfare state. I myself grew up in one of the most successful welfare states (Sweden), which converted the massive economic growth after 1945 into a distribution of wealth across society. While my grandparents were poor peasants in northern Sweden, my parents could ascend to stable middle-class lives thanks to free public education and a booming economy. When I grew up, everyone in Sweden received free health care and free childcare, and all education including university was free. It was the pinnacle of a development that started in the nineteenth century, when workers began to organize politically and gradually improved everything from labor conditions to voting rights and public services. Social democracy, however, restricts itself to transforming the mode of distribution and remains dependent on the capitalist mode of production.

---

> As a consequence, the fate of the welfare state is bound to the fate of the capitalist economy. During a few decades after World War II, it could seem as if social democracy had found a way to tame capitalism and put it to work for the common good. Yet the crisis in the world economy in the 1970s—and the slow compound growth ever since—clearly recalls that capitalism is in control of the welfare state and not the other way around. ([Location 4797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4797))

---

> The welfare state depends on capitalism (since the social democratic welfare system literally lives off the wealth generated by wage labor), but capitalism does not depend on the welfare state. Thus, with less wealth to distribute across society because of economic crises, the neoliberal strategies to generate more compound growth—deregulation of the job market, privatization of public services, and so on—won political assent.

> A universal basic income can thus have emancipatory effects. Yet it is seriously misleading to describe UBI—as Calnitsky and many others do—as a potential solution to the problem of wage labor that Marx analyzed. ([Location 4828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4828))

---

> Calnitsky fails to grasp, however, that a UBI cannot even in principle overcome the dependence on wage labor. On the contrary, any form of universal basic income is altogether dependent on the social form of wage labor, since any form of UBI consists in a redistribution of the capital wealth that is generated by wage labor. Under capitalism, wage labor in the service of profit is the necessary source of social wealth. This dependence on wage labor is perpetuated rather than overcome by a UBI.

Advocates of a universal basic income (or other forms of redistributive justice) never question the measure and production of value under capitalism but focus only on the distribution of wealth across society. For the same reason, they cannot grasp the contradiction in which any progressive reform of capitalism will be caught, whether it seeks to strengthen the welfare state, provide a universal basic income, or combine the two.

---

> Unemployment and the exportation of jobs are not something that can be removed under capitalism, but a necessary condition for the production of capital wealth. Lowering the relative value of wages and sustaining a rate of profit depends on a surplus population of the unemployed who are willing to work for less, either domestically or in poorer countries to which production is moved. ([Location 4933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4933))

---

> Hence, it is a grave mistake to think that the tendency toward crises heralds the end of capitalism. Crises are essential to cycles of capitalist accumulation and necessary for the continued production of capital wealth. For the rate of profit to rise again, the ratio of living labor time must increase relative to nonliving production time, which requires the devaluation or destruction of productive capital. ([Location 4944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=4944))

---

> Nevertheless, many avowed Marxists continue to hinge their critique of capitalism on the prediction of a “terminal crisis.” Such a critique of capitalism is deeply misguided. The problem with capitalism is not that it will collapse, but that it can sustain itself only through a self-contradictory dynamic that has pernicious social consequences. Given the capitalist measure of social wealth, the free time we gain thanks to technological efficiency cannot be recognized as a value in itself. Increased technological productivity could give everyone more free time to lead their lives, if we pursued technological innovation for the sake of emancipation rather than for the sake of profit.

> Questions of economic organization, however, are not reducible to the means with which we pursue our ends. Rather, how we organize the economy of our lives is itself an expression of how we posit the relation between means and ends. Economical questions are at the heart of any form of spiritual life, since they concern our order of priorities. How we organize the economy of our lives is ultimately a matter of how we understand the value of different activities and what we take to be worth doing with our time.

If it is more profitable to restrain my production capacities and create an artificial scarcity, I will do that instead. Likewise, as a capitalist, I am not trying to obtain the right kind of “information” about the actual needs of the population, so that my supply can meet the relevant demands. My aim is rather to manipulate both supply and demand for the sake of maximal gain, regardless of the social consequences.

> Far from safeguarding our economic freedom, capitalism deprives us of the ability to decide our economic priorities and democratically deliberate on the form of our economic life. The priority of our economy is already determined for us—to labor for the sake of profit—since it is built into the capitalist definition of social wealth.

> Hayek cannot see the problem in question, since he reduces freedom to liberty.56 As long as we are not directly coerced to act in one way rather than another—i.e., as long as we have formal liberty—we are free in the relevant sense for Hayek. For the same reason, Hayek in effect reduces decision to choice. As long as we can make a choice without anyone forcing us or telling us what to do, we are free. ([Location 5057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5057))

---

> Such a formal conception of freedom, however, is utterly impoverished. To lead a free life it is not sufficient that we are exempt from direct coercion and allowed to make choices. To lead a free life we must be able to recognize ourselves in what we do, to see our practical activities as expressions of our own commitments. This requires that we are able to engage not only in choices but also in fundamental decisions regarding the purposes that determine our range of choices and for the sake of which we lead our lives. ([Location 5061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5061))

---

> Under capitalism we are all in practice committed to a purpose in which we cannot recognize ourselves, which inevitably leads to alienated forms of social life. The actual needs and abilities we have are secondary; what matters first of all is whether capitalists can profit from our needs and exploit our abilities in wage labor. The market decides which abilities we should harness, while our needs are transformed in view of what we can buy. Many of the abilities that we could develop—if we had the time to lead our lives—are discarded because they are not deemed to be profitable, and many needs are engineered to make us purchase more commodities rather than to provide satisfaction.

([Location 5078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5078))

---

> The general and concrete principles of democratic socialism cannot be posited as an ideal that is external to our historical form of life, since in that case they would have no claim on us. The principles must be internally derived from the Idea of freedom through which we already seek to justify liberal democracy and capitalism. As I have emphasized throughout, the critique of liberalism and capitalism must be an immanent critique, which locates the resources for emancipation within the commitments we already avow. ([Location 5087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5087))

---

> The first principle of democratic socialism is that we measure our wealth—both individual and collective—in terms of socially available free time. Our free time depends on social and institutional forms because it does not concern a mere quantity of time. Rather, our quantity of free time is inseparable from the quality of our free time, which requires institutions that allow us to shape, cultivate, and transform the commitments in light of which we lead our lives. For the same reason, free time is not necessarily leisure time but any time we devote to activities that for us count as ends in themselves. For example, the time I devote to writing this book counts as free time, since having time to think through and articulate fundamental philosophical ideas is an end in itself for me. ([Location 5095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5095))

---

> Our social institutions are not necessarily explicit but always implicit in what we do and in all forms of practical identities (e.g., being a philosopher or being a parent). All the activities we regard as essential parts of a practical identity—as essential parts of a vocation with which we identify—belong to the realm of freedom, and the time we devote to them counts as free time. ([Location 5103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5103))

---

> All practical identities (e.g., parent, philosopher, political activist) are social roles, but not all social roles we take on count as practical identities for us. Only the social roles with which we identify as ends in themselves are practical identities for us, whereas other social roles merely serve as means to an end. To be clear, even a mere social role has normative criteria that we can seek to fulfill or transform in light of an end to which we are committed, as when we participate in sanitation work for the sake of the common good.

---

> In light of the first principle of democratic socialism—the measure of our wealth in terms of socially available free time—we are committed to reducing our socially necessary labor time through technological innovation.

---

> The second principle of democratic socialism is that the means of production are collectively owned and cannot be used for the sake of profit.

While we can have private property in a concrete sense, however, we cannot have private property in the abstract sense that transforms property into a commodity that can be bought and sold for profit. The recognition of your property as your property is not based on your right to its abstract value as a commodity (or as a means for producing commodities), but on your right to its concrete specificity as valuable to you and as useful for you in leading your life.

> An instructive example is Internet service. Under democratic socialism, everyone would have Internet access at the maximal speed enabled by our currently available technology, with a collective commitment to create technology that makes Internet access even faster and possible to maintain with even less socially necessary labor. While our democratic state provides the Internet service, the actual use and applications of the Internet are not restricted by the dictates of a central planning committee. Rather, we have both the material resources and the socially available free time to develop applications that resolve problems which emerge in “the particular circumstances of time and place”—to recall Hayek’s language—allowing for “the utilization of knowledge which is not given to anyone in its totality” and drawing on “unique information of which beneficial use might be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to [the individual] or are made with his active cooperation.” ([Location 5156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5156))

---

> In a capitalist free market, by contrast, Internet service will always be provided by regional monopolies that operate for profit. Contrary to what Hayek assumes, monopolies tend to form naturally in a free market, since private ownership of the required technological infrastructure makes it harder and harder to compete with the company that has built the dominant network. Given the profit motive, a company has no inherent interest in offering us general Internet access at the maximal speed possible. Slower and partial access will be preferred if that is more profitable. ([Location 5168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5168))

> Hence, the third principle of democratic socialism is the one formulated by Marx: “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.”57 Marx does not develop the meaning of the principle, but in light of the first two principles of democratic socialism we can elaborate the implications. The aim of democratic socialism is to allow us not only to live our lives by satisfying our needs but also to lead our lives by cultivating our abilities. We are collectively committed to producing the necessary means of subsistence, as well as the means and institutions for each one to pursue the activities that matter to him or her (painting, writing, music, athletics, theater, and so on).

> society. The idea, however, is that we will be intrinsically motivated to participate in social labor when we can recognize that the social production is for the sake of the common good and our own freedom to lead a life. Capitalist wage labor is inherently alienating, since we are not part of deciding the purpose of what we are producing and our work is conceived for the sake of a profit that is posited as an end in itself rather than as a means to our freedom.

> Even tedious work we do in the realm of necessity—e.g., participating in the garbage removal in our neighborhood on a weekly basis—can be seen in light of the realm of freedom, since the work is geared toward reducing socially necessary labor time and increasing socially available free time.

> Those who object that we will not be motivated to work unless we have to secure our survival—or have the chance to make a monetary profit—should consider their lack of faith in our spiritual freedom. Their argument assumes that we need to be commanded by a single ought of survival or profit in order to work and cannot be allowed to engage the double ought of our spiritual freedom. A single ought of survival or profit alienates us from our spiritual freedom, since it commands us to work on the basis of a perceived necessity rather than in light of a responsibility to which we have bound ourselves. Only if we are granted the material, social, and institutional resources to exercise our spiritual freedom can we actually identify with what we are doing as our own activity.

> Under democratic socialism, we have three ways of reducing and qualitatively transforming socially necessary labor time. ([Location 5232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5232))

---

> First, large parts of our socially necessary labor can be done in the realm of freedom, insofar as it is performed by persons who are committed to the occupation as an end in itself and thus take up the required social role as a practical identity in light of which they lead their lives. For example, architecture is a socially necessary form of labor, since we cannot live our lives without inhabiting spaces that are conducive to our activities. Yet if the work of planning buildings is valuable in itself for the architect, the time she devotes to architecture does not count as a negative cost of socially necessary labor time but as a positive access to socially available free time. Her socially necessary labor as an architect is being done in the realm of freedom rather than in the realm of necessity. ([Location 5233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5233))

---

> Second, the socially necessary labor that no one wants to do for its own sake (that everyone counts as a negative cost of necessary labor time) is not being done as alienated labor by persons who need money to survive and cannot identify with the social purpose of what they are doing. Rather, the socially necessary labor time is qualitatively transformed in being shared by members of society on the basis of their abilities and commitments, with the explicit purpose of contributing to a common good that everyone can recognize as devoted to improving their own possibilities of leading a free life. ([Location 5238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5238))

---

> Third, through technological development and innovative solutions, we are collectively committed to reducing the labor time that is socially necessary to maintain our lives and increasing the free time that is socially available to lead our lives. Reducing socially necessary labor time does not necessarily mean that we spend less time on socially necessary labor, but that the time we spend on such labor is to a greater degree a matter of socially available free time. ([Location 5246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5246))

---

> The project of reducing socially necessary labor time, however, should not be conflated with an aspiration to eliminate socially necessary labor time. It is neither possible nor desirable to eliminate socially necessary labor time altogether. Our lives will always require some form of maintenance and the question of how to maintain our material lives is an intrinsic part of our spiritual freedom. Eliminating socially necessary labor time is not even an intelligible goal for a free life, since the question of where to draw the distinction between necessity and freedom must itself remain a living question for anyone who leads a free life.

---

> An illuminating example is the production and consumption of artworks. Under capitalism, “owning” a work of art means having the abstract property right to a work of art rather than having the concrete ability to appreciate and understand the object in question. Under capitalism, we can be “owners” of artworks while having a merely abstract relation to the objects in question. We can hang a Cézanne on our wall as a token of social prestige without having either the time to appreciate it or the education to grasp its significance. Furthermore, artists under capitalism have the abstract property right to their works of art, but concretely they have to sell their artworks for profit in order to make a living. Under democratic socialism, by contrast, artworks cannot be commodities that are bought and sold for profit, but artists have the concrete property right to their work—in the sense that no one can take it away from them against their will—by virtue of having created it.

Suffering, boredom, and anxiety before death are not reducible to psychological states—or historically specific pathologies—but rather necessary conditions for leading a free life. The relation to suffering, boredom, and death renders intelligible how leading our lives can matter to us in the first place.

We can and should do better. On the other hand, if we conflate historically or socially specific forms of suffering, boredom, and death with the existential categories of suffering, boredom, and death per se, we deprive ourselves of the ability to identify the actual forms of suffering that we are committed to overcoming. Instead of engaging the problem of how to identify and transform the pernicious ways in which we are leading our finite lives, the problem is conflated with the fact that we are leading a finite life at all. We are thus led to the dead end of religious despair over finite life itself and saddled with the religious longing for a redemption from the condition of finitude.

> The critique of religion—like the critique of capitalism—must therefore be an immanent critique. We must locate the resources for overcoming the religious understanding of finitude within the practice of faith and its commitment to a shared social life. The practice of religious faith has often served—and still serves for many—as an important communal expression of solidarity. Likewise, religious organizations often provide services for those who are poor and in need. Most importantly, religious discourses have often been mobilized in concrete struggles against injustice. None of these social commitments, however, requires religious faith or a religious form of organization. For these commitments to fulfill their promise of emancipation, religious faith must be converted into secular faith and be devoted to social justice as an end in itself. If we are committed to abolishing poverty rather than promising salvation for the poor, the faith we embody in practice is secular rather than religious, since we acknowledge our life together as our ultimate purpose. This argument—which brings together secular faith and spiritual freedom in the pursuit of actual emancipation—leads us to the concluding movement of this book.

> The maintenance of dual labor markets (black and white) is economically irrational under capitalism, since it creates an artificial barrier to labor recruitment and prevents each unit from being treated as abstractly equivalent for the sake of efficiency. A simple but illuminating example (which I borrow from Adolph Reed, Jr.) is the economic wastefulness of having to maintain two different sets of toilets—for blacks and whites respectively—in the plants.6 More generally, the violent instability of the segregationist South was itself inefficient and an obstacle that needed to be removed for capitalist enterprise to expand.

> As King made clear, nonviolent action is not passive and submissive but militant and coercive. “Nonviolence must be adapted to urban conditions and urban moods,” King avowed. “We must fashion the new tactics which do not count on government goodwill, but instead serve to compel unwilling authorities to yield to the mandates of justice.” ([Location 5698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5698))

> To this end, King argued that “militant non-violence” was not only morally but also pragmatically and politically superior to violent riots. “To dislocate the functioning of a city without destroying it can be more effective than a riot because it can be longer-lasting, costly to the larger society, but not wantonly destructive.”11 King rightly predicted that riots would only strengthen the right-wing demonization of the black population and facilitate repressive measures on the part of the governing authorities. By contrast, politically articulated forms of mass civil disobedience—which highlight actual forms of racial and economic inequality—exhibit moral authority in practice and are “more difficult for the government to quell by superior force.” ([Location 5702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5702))

> King was well aware of the opposition he would meet from those in power, but it did not prevent him from radicalizing his public stance. “Something is wrong with the economic system of our nation,” King emphasized more and more often in the last years of his life. “Something is wrong with capitalism.”17 These were not abstract claims but directly linked to the concrete problems regarding housing, education, and welfare that he encountered while working in the ghettos of the North, as well as with the urban and rural poor in the South. “For years I labored with the idea of reforming the existing institutions of the society, a little change here, a little change there,” King said in an interview in 1967. “Now I feel quite differently, I think you’ve got to have a reconstruction of the entire society, a revolution of values.” ([Location 5730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5730))

And then you just go up to him and say, ‘Now, you’re free.’ But you don’t give him any bus fare to get to town. You don’t give him any money to get some clothes to put on his back. You don’t give him anything to get started in life again….We were left illiterate, penniless, just told, ‘you’re free.’ ”31 In the same period of U.S. history, King recalls, Congress was giving away millions of acres of land to white peasants from Europe, for whom the state “built land-grant colleges to teach them how to farm, provided county agents to further expertise in farming, and then later provided low interest rates so that they could mechanize their farms.” ([Location 5788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5788))

> As King was well aware, however, such a solution can never address the root of the problem, which is fundamentally economic. A society that seeks to promote true equality of opportunity cannot limit itself to having a few representatives of an ethnically defined group in positions of power, while the mechanisms of economic marginalization continue to be operative for the majority. Rather, facilitating true equality of opportunity requires that every citizen have adequate resources for material well-being, education, and social recognition.

> In his speeches and books, King keeps returning to automation as a double-edged phenomenon. The automation of previously necessary labor should be emancipatory, since it liberates us from the need to expend our lifetime on tedious forms of work. Yet, under capitalism, automation does not lead to the emancipation of workers but rather to their unemployment, which makes them available for further exploitation in temporary jobs and with lower wages. “As machines replace men, we must again question whether the depth of our social thinking matches the growth of our technological creativity,” King emphasizes in a speech to the Workers Union of America in 1962.36 “We cannot create machines which revolutionize industry unless we simultaneously create ideas commensurate with social and economic reorganization, which harness the power of such machines for the benefit of man. The new age will not be an era of hope but of fear and emptiness unless we master this problem.” ([Location 5819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5819))

> The reformation of capitalism through the redistribution of wealth can never achieve such a transformation of society, since the wealth to be distributed is produced by the social relations of capitalist exploitation and commodification. The more we restrict exploitation and commodification, the less wealth we have to distribute. This practical contradiction in any progressive attempt to redistribute wealth is unavoidable as long as we live under capitalism. If we are to understand the concrete challenges that will face all redistributive reforms, we need to recognize the practical contradiction and take it into account in pursuing our political strategies as well as in articulating our priorities.

> The two forms of consciousness that Marx identifies as the main subjects of critique are religious and political. Our religious and political self-understanding are the main subjects of critique for Marx—as they are for me in the chapters of This Life—since religion and politics are the dominant forms in which we express our understanding of what we struggle for, what we are dreaming of, and what we desire. To transform our understanding of our struggles, our dreams, and our desires, we must therefore transform the practice of religion and politics.

> Already as an undergraduate at Crozer Theological Seminary, King had read Hegel, and while pursuing his doctorate at Boston University he studied Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit as well as his Philosophy of History and Philosophy of Right. Indeed, the philosophical discussion group that King hosted in his Boston apartment was called “the dialectical society,” named after the dialectical method of philosophy that Hegel articulated and that Marx sought to develop in his own way.

> Hegel lived in Europe during a historical period (1770–1831) characterized by great political revolutions and profound transformations in the understanding of what it means to be free, stretching from the American Revolution in the 1770s to the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution and economic globalization in the first decades of the 1800s. For Hegel, the two most important events were the publication of Immanuel Kant’s revolutionary philosophical trilogy—Critique of Pure Reason (1781), Critique of Practical Reason (1788), Critique of Judgment (1790)—and the French Revolution that began in 1789. Both of these events disclosed the stakes of a modern, secular conception of freedom that Hegel pursued throughout his philosophical trajectory. 59 ([Location 5965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=5965))

> Kant’s revolutionary move is to argue that the question of authority cannot be settled by appeals to religion, tradition, or the given laws of the state. For a given law to be binding, we must hold ourselves to be bound by it. A given law cannot have authority automatically and by itself—it must be taken as authoritative by us to have authority over us. For the same reason, a given law can lose its hold over us or be called into question by us, which was dramatically demonstrated by the French Revolution and more generally by the transition from monarchy to democracy.

> We do not merely have a sense of what we ought to do (a given norm); we also have the capacity to ask ourselves if we ought to do what we supposedly ought to do. This double ought structure is at the heart of what I have called our spiritual freedom. In Hegel’s terms, we are not simply conscious of what we do but self-conscious of being answerable for what we do and thereby capable of questioning the principles of our practices. ([Location 6046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6046))

---

> For Hegel, the important task is to build institutional practices that acknowledge and enable us to cultivate our spiritual freedom. The problem with religious forms of faith, then, is that they ultimately disown our spiritual freedom. In order to engage the question of who we should be and what we should do, we must recognize that we ourselves produce the communal norms that we seek to defend, critique, or transform. ([Location 6050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6050))

---

> In Hegel’s account, the self-understanding of religious believers is therefore at odds with their own practical activity. The actual object of devotion in the practice of faith is the community itself. The Christian Trinity is not an independently existing reality but a pictorial representation of the structure of the community of believers. “God” is a name for the self-legislated communal norms (the principles to which the congregation holds itself); “Christ” is a name for the social actors who sustain the norms through their embodied practices; and “the Holy Spirit” is a name for the institutional relations of the Church through which the norms are actualized. By going to church and worshipping together, the members of the congregation bring into being a form of spiritual life: they hold one another responsible, treat one another as committed, and acknowledge one another’s personal dignity. ([Location 6055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6055))

---

> Such mutual dependence is at the heart of any form of spiritual life, which must be developed and sustained through social practices of recognition that are materially embodied. The religious community, however, does not understand its own activity to be an end in itself. Rather, the individual members take the religious community to be a means for the end of serving an independently existing God and earning a salvation that transcends the fragility of the shared congregational life.

> The life-defining norms to which we hold ourselves (God) can exist only by being embodied in our practices as individual social actors (Christ), who can live on and be recognized for who we are only through the institutional relations that we share (the Holy Spirit).

> For the same reason, the Idea of who we ought to be is itself something that can be challenged and transformed. Because any Idea—whether of an individual or a collective—must be embodied in practice, the Idea of who we ought to be can always be taken up in a different way, called into question, and be the subject of a revolution.

> Far from advocating such invulnerability, a secular reconciliation with finitude acknowledges that we must be vulnerable—we must be marked by the suffering of pain, the mourning of loss, the anxiety before death—in order to lead our lives and care about one another. Only through such an acknowledgment can we turn away from the religious promise of absolution and turn toward our time together. Only through such an acknowledgment can we understand the urgency of changing our lives. We are reconciled with being alive, but for that very reason we are not reconciled to living unworthy lives. We demand a better society and we know that it depends on us. In taking action, we are not waiting for a timeless future but grasp in practice that our time is all we have.

To engage their implications, we must here make explicit the final aspect of secular faith.

Before we can decide anything, we are already constrained by the spiritual causes we inherit from the social world into which we are born. Nevertheless, we are responsible for sustaining, contesting, or changing the spiritual causes that determine the stakes of our actions. For there to be demands of parenthood, artistic vocations, and political causes, we must hold ourselves to those demands and thereby believe that they matter.

> When we own our secular faith, we acknowledge that the object of our faith—our spiritual cause—is dependent on our practice of faith.

> When King says that “God” has commanded us to help the poor to emancipate themselves—and that he is doing “God’s will” in pursuing social freedom as an end in itself—King cannot be referring to the religious notion of an eternal God, since by his own admission he cannot determine the will of such a God. The command or the will of God only makes sense if we understand the term in a Hegelian way. “God” is a name for the communal norms that we have legislated to ourselves and to which we hold ourselves.

A general strike in Memphis would have brought home in the most concrete way that the city could not function without the labor of the black population who were working full-time but nevertheless living in poverty. As Honey argues in his study of the Memphis strike, “nonviolent direct action on such a scale would have marked a turning point in the trajectory of the black freedom struggles of the 1960s,”91 which could have led to a further radicalization of the movement led by King.

What can be said is that the murder of King belongs to a number of murders of socialist organizers in the 1960s, along with other forms of violent repression that gradually weakened the struggle for freedom. The sanitation workers in Memphis did win their strike, and their labor conditions were improved, but the larger project to which the strike belonged for King (the Poor People’s Campaign) was defeated shortly after his death.

For the same reason, that we collectively value the “growth” of capital as the final purpose of our economy is not reducible to the reigning ideology of neoliberal capitalism.

> there is only one fundamental definition of capitalism. Capitalism is a historical form of life in which wage labor is the foundation of social wealth. We live in a global capitalist world because all of us depend for our survival on the social wealth generated by wage labor. In order to generate wealth through the social form of the wage relation, we must exploit labor time and consume commodities that are made for profit. The production of all our goods and services is mediated by the social form of wage labor, since even how much free time we have to produce goods or services for nonprofit depends on the wage we receive or the capital we have. Moreover, the production of the capital wealth that is distributed in the form of wages requires that there is a “growth” of value in the economy, which is possible only if we continue to exploit and commodify our lives for the sake of profit.

As living beings, we seek self-satisfaction—and there is nothing degrading about being alive, nothing sinful about seeking self-satisfaction—but since we are spiritually living beings it is not naturally given what counts as self-satisfaction for us.

> Moreover, if our collective spiritual cause is profit, all of us will tend to understand ourselves as individuals who have no intrinsic motivation to care for the common good, since we cannot see ourselves in the collective purpose of our society. Indeed, no one can see herself in the purpose of profit, since it treats our lives as means rather than as ends in themselves. This is why capitalism is an inherently alienating form of social life.

> Since profit is our collective spiritual cause under capitalism, which determines how we materially reproduce our lives, we cannot overcome its power through mere individual will or a change of the official worldview of our society. Rather, we must practically transform how we sustain our lives all the way down to the production of the social goods that we need.

> We can discover our individual abilities through activities of teaching, learning, and leisure, as well as come to understand our collective needs by sharing the socially necessary forms of labor. ([Location 6570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6570))

> The point of democratic socialism is not to impose a general consensus regarding what matters, but to sustain a form of life that makes it possible for us to own the question of what is worth doing with our lives—what we value individually as well as collectively—as an irreducible question of our lives.

> since such security would eliminate our freedom. The point is rather to have a society that enables our cooperation in mutual recognition of the freedom of one another. Nothing can secure the actual exercise of mutual recognition, but mutual recognition can be enabled or disabled depending on the principles to which we strive to hold ourselves, depending on the spiritual cause that moves our actions in social space and time. For our mutual recognition to be enabled rather than disabled, the purposive principles of our society must be possible to grasp in practice as being for the sake of both the common good and our individual ability to lead a life. To be emancipated rather than alienated we must be able to see ourselves—to recognize our own commitment to social freedom—in the purposive principles of our society. These principles must do justice to the inseparability of our material and spiritual life, to how economic questions of priority are at the heart of our exercise of freedom both individually and collectively. The principles of democratic socialism designate what those principles of a free society must be. ([Location 6582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6582))

> Likewise, the institution of marriage will no longer be mediated by religious faith or capitalist property rights, and there will be multiple forms of institutionalizing partnerships. For these very reasons, however, the partnerships in question will be explicitly recognized as ends in themselves. Thus, it will make all the more sense to have ceremonies that acknowledge and celebrate those who are willing to take the risk of making a life-defining commitment to another person. Finally—recalling the issue I pursued in chapter 1—our funeral ceremonies will be able to honor and avow the devastating loss of an irreplaceable person. Rather than disown our mourning through the supposed consolation of eternal life, we will be able to own our pain as something that we ought to feel in the face of death.

> On the contrary, only from the standpoint of secular faith can we understand the actual significance of baptisms, marriages, and funerals, as expressions of historical commitments that matter because we have to sustain them. The Hegelian insight regarding religious practices—that “God” is a name for the communal norms that we have legislated to ourselves—is therefore necessary but not sufficient. To complete our emancipation, we ought to remove all remaining forms of political theology by removing any appeal to “God” in favor of the explicit democratic recognition that what ultimately matters is our relations to one another.

> At the end of the day all forms of political theology are antidemocratic, since they assume that we must defer to a higher authority than we the people in order to hold together as a community. The movement toward democratic socialism is thus inseparable from the overcoming of political theology and the withering away of religious faith.

> To make our emancipation actual will require both our political mobilizations and our rational arguments; it will require our general strikes and our systematic reflections, our labor and our love, our anxiety and our passion. We only have a chance to achieve democratic socialism if we grasp that everything is at stake in what we do with our finite time together. We only have a chance to make it a reality if we help one another to own our only life. This is how we overcome and how we move forward—not toward the new Jerusalem but toward the new Memphis, the new Los Angeles, the new Chicago, the new New Haven, and the new New York.

> Hegel makes a similar distinction in analyzing how certain animals—as distinct from plants—have a capacity for “self-enjoyment,” which is expressed through what Hegel calls “the artistic impulse” that is one aspect of “the constructive instinct” of animals (Philosophy of Nature, pp. 406–409). Most suggestively, Hegel argues that birdsong expresses a capacity for self-enjoyment that is distinguishable from the activity of mere self-preservation. Birdsong is a “distinterested” activity, not in the sense of being contemplative but in the sense of being an end in itself for the bird—enjoyed for its own sake (Philosophy of Nature, p. 409).

> For an excellent analysis of the difference between Marx and earlier socialist writers on this point, see William Roberts, Marx’s Inferno: The Political Theory of Capital. Roberts’s deeply insightful reading of Capital appeared toward the end of my work on this book, but I hope to engage it on another occasion.
