The Buddhist term [[Dependent Arising]] can apply to the act of theater.

One of theater's unique qualities (see: [[↯ What is the defining "thing" of theatre?]]) is its liveness. (For a counter, also look at [[@hunter2019WeAreNot]] and [[Is Ephemerality an essential quality to theatre?]]) That means that each performance is, in essence, different: performers are interacting with the different qualities of the energy in the room, fed by the audience. And the audience is bringing to bear their own unique inner/outer conditions as well. Thus the relationship between the "quality" is symbiotic with the quality of the room. A bored audience leads to a bored piece; the two feed into each other.

In essence, theater is empty — there's no origin.

See: [[Dynamic Theater vs Static Film]], and Peter Brook on this:

![[The Empty Space by Peter Brook Notes#^506347]]

Theater is always now.
