Not sure....

#note/question/meta 

Are "hub" notes "lower down" MOCs? Is there any value in that?

Or should they all be MOCs, and the up/down key maybe indicates direction/hierarchy.

hub, index, outline - see my backlinks for an example of something that feels like it shouldn't be its own map â€” or should it?  how to determine hierarchy? breadcrumbs plugin?

Another thought: maybe their "scope" is determined by their Path? I keep the bigger stuff in the Atlas folder or Atlas/Moc or atlas/moc/library, and then the smaller "ad-hoc" style ones are in the Notes folder
