From [[ð– « A New Program for Graphic Design - Reinfurt]]\(emphasis my own):

> It's a brilliant piece of design. Quite simple. The Ulm stool was meant to do several different things. It was meant to be a seat, but it was also meant to store books. It was used as a side table, a small podium. It has a round rod on the bottom for carrying it around, as it was meant to travel easily thorughout the school. **The stool had a group of functions that was recognized in advance of the object and these function constituted its design**. This stool needed to be student-specific, to work for sitting, travel easily to classes, be toted around campus; it should work as a bookshelf, a table, and maybe even as kind of standing platform. **Given those constraints, those demands, the shape and the form emerged almost naturally**.
