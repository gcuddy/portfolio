if you look at any entrepreneur 101 shit, the creator economy, hustle culture...
most people do recognize that [[capitalism requires working to live, selling our own lives in the process]], or at least that wage labor involves selling your time and giving up your life. The "american dream" is to escape this, in some sense.
And yet, shouldn't this belie that capitalism is fundamentally broken? Most people don't go that extra step, though, which is to recognize that a society that neccesitates exploitation ([[capitalism necessarily depends on exploited labor]]) is an unjust, immoral, and, importantly, un-free (see [[freedom]]) society.
they seek to maintain status quo because of [[capitalist realism]] and [[capitalist realism results from lack of imagination]]
