Coinage from Jonathan Chapman, and brought to my attention by Kieran Fenby-Hulse's paper "Rethinking the Digital Playlist: Mixtapes, Nostalgia and Emotionally Durable Design"

Fenby-Hulse considers the *mixtape* as an example of "emotionally durable design": it's a **physical** object with an "aesthetic, craft-like process". (x:: [[The mixtape was a means of asynchronous emotional communication 20220211233730]],)

"Narrative, attachment, enchantment, surface, and consciousness" are embedded into the design process.

"The challenge that we face now is how to translate the haptic, material and sonic experience of the mixtape into the digital realm"

* [[Translating haptic, material experiences into the digital realm]]

What else could be considered to have emotionally durable design? Where else does that apply?

In the experience of theater, arts.

What about software and hardware and technology?
