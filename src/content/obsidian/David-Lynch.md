## Highlights
- THERE ARE FOUR turning points in the creative life of David Lynch, four decisive moments that turned a common Irish last name into an adjective for our time. 1961: In Alexandria, Virginia, a girlfriend introduces fifteen-year-old David Lynch to a boy named Toby Keeler, whose father, Bushnell, is an artist. The senior Keeler paints landscapes, still lifes, nautical scenes: mantelpiece art, good enough to sell. Lynch, visiting his studio, is shocked to learn it’s possible to make a living that way. Bushnell Keeler gives the boy a book called The Art Spirit by the painter Robert Henri. A leader of the realist movement known as the Ashcan school, which favored gritty urban scenes and rallied around the credo “art for life’s sake,” Henri was also an inspirational teacher (of Edward Hopper and George Bellows, among others). The book is a collection of his notes and talks to students, combining technical instruction with musings on art as the source of “our greatest happiness,” peppered with motivational refrains (“Do some great work, Son!”). For the teenage Lynch, it changes everything, becomes a symbol of possibility. He decides to dedicate himself to the noble and romantic pursuit of art making, or, as he likes to call it, the “art life.” ([Location 23](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=23))
- 1967: Lynch is now a painting student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where, as it happens, Robert Henri studied in the 1880s. Lynch has landed in Philadelphia after a brief stint at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and an abortive trip to Europe to study with the expressionist painter Oskar Kokoschka. For a small-town boy, the violence and squalor of Philly — especially in Lynch’s run-down postindustrial neighborhood — is nightmarish but it’s also where he starts to find his footing as an artist, where he has his “first original thought.” His paintings become literally and figuratively darker. One afternoon, while he’s working on a nearly all-black painting of a garden at night, he senses a wind emanating from within the canvas, seeming to stir the leaves under his brush. He wonders: What if paintings could move? What if they had sound? For the school’s annual contest a few months later, Lynch submits a mixed-media piece: a sculpted screen onto which he projects a stop-motion animated loop that depicts, over and over, a row of figures in agony, their stomachs and esophageal tracts filling up with red liquid that is expelled in a collective retch, accompanied by the sound of a blaring siren. He calls this, his first film, Six Men Getting Sick. It shares the first prize. ([Location 33](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=33))
- 1973: As much as Lynch loves his new home of Los Angeles — where he relocated with his artist wife, Peggy, and their baby daughter, Jennifer, to enroll at the brand-new American Film Institute Conservatory in 1969 — this is a low moment for him. He’s mired in the seemingly interminable production of his first feature, Eraserhead; the stop-start no-budget shoot will drag on for three more years. The responsibilities of being a family man in his midtwenties are also taking a toll. Anxious and depressed, he loses… ([Location 42](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=42))
- The experience is so overwhelming — “pure bliss” — that he doesn’t notice time elapsing. A creature of habit, Lynch claims to have never missed a session since: twenty minutes, twice a day. He credits TM with increasing his “flow of creativity”… ([Location 50](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=50))
- The fourth moment is harder to locate. Perhaps it is after his most notorious flop, Dune, which prompts him to declare that he would rather not make a film than make one that would not allow him final cut. Perhaps it is after the cancellation of his most surprising success, the TV series Twin Peaks, which causes him to write, in capital letters, on a wooden… ([Location 52](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=52))
- Whenever it may be, Lynch acquires the will or temperament it takes to be an artist who is never less than fully himself, even within an industrial medium and… ([Location 58](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=58))
- More than five years after the start of shooting, Eraserhead premiered at the Filmex festival in Los Angeles in March 1977. It was reviewed in Variety under the headline “Dismal American Film Institute Exercise in Gore; Commercial Prospects Nil.” As a midnight movie, it ran for more than three years in New York City and Los Angeles,… ([Location 60](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=60))
- His follow-up, The Elephant Man, produced by Mel Brooks, earned him an Academy Award nomination. His next film, Dune, was one of the most notorious commercial and critical disasters of all time. The one after that, Blue Velvet, became one of the decade’s touchstone works of art. Time magazine put him on the cover in 1990,… ([Location 63](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=63))
- Lynch won the Palme d’Or, the prestigious top prize at Cannes, in 1990 for Wild at Heart; at the festival two years later, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me was booed and he was heckled at his press conference. Next came Lost Highway, widely considered his most perplexing movie to date. Short of critical raves to choose from, the distributor used a Siskel and Ebert slam — TWO THUMBS DOWN! — in the ads. The follow-up, The… ([Location 67](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=67))
- When ABC, the network that axed Twin Peaks, nixed his proposed series, Mulholland Drive, he turned the unfinished pilot episode into a stand-alone movie, which earned him his best reviews since Blue Velvet and another Academy Award nomination. His response to this unlikely triumph was to insist on more artistic freedom, which he… ([Location 72](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=72))
- He shot Inland Empire on a cheap, consumer-grade digital-video camera, in much the same fashion as Eraserhead: piecemeal over several years. He also self-distributed the film, and in one promotional gambit, he parked himself on a Hollywood… ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=75))
- Lynch has been a renaissance man all his working life: He drew a weekly cartoon strip called The Angriest Dog in the World for a full decade and has always found time for painting,… ([Location 78](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=78))
- Lynch’s career is a series of ups and downs, filled with meteoric rises, spectacular collapses, unexpected detours, and long bouts of inactivity. Looked at another way, it is also a model of constancy, a testament to a single-mindedness that verges on the autistic. ([Location 90](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=90))
- If “Kafkaesque” implies an atmosphere of ominous illogic and “Borgesian” suggests a garden of forking paths, if “Capraesque” connotes feel-good optimism and “Felliniesque” conjures carnival-like fantasy, “Lynchian” means — well, this is where things get both tricky and interesting. ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=101))
- The paradox of the Lynchian sensibility is that it is at once easy to recognize and hard to define. The quaint small towns of Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks seem indelibly Lynchian, but so do the haunted Los Angeles nightscapes of Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive and the two-lane highways of Wild at Heart and The Straight Story. ([Location 104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=104))
- The term is bandied about so frequently by now that it is simply, more often than not, a synonym for “weird.” But that overuse attests to the curiously central place that Lynch occupies in the cultural consciousness, despite his relatively scant filmography. The singularity of his work is a big part of it — as is the sheer improbability of his career, the sense that he has always been an anomaly. Born in 1946, Lynch is an exact contemporary of Steven Spielberg. Eraserhead had its premiere just two months before George Lucas’s Star Wars. Lynch belongs to the generation that also includes Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, and Terrence Malick (his classmate at the American Film Institute). But unlike most of his peers, Lynch reshaped American cinema without ever being absorbed into the Hollywood establishment. Quite the opposite, in fact: Lynch’s signal achievement is the degree to which he has infiltrated the mainstream with an essentially avant-garde aesthetic. ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=127))
- Lynch rarely appears in his films, which are not confessional in any obvious way, but they cultivate a psychological intimacy all the same. They give the impression of having been mainlined straight from his unconscious, and they seek to activate something in ours. It is hard to know how to take them except personally. ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=137))
- He proposes a working theory of filmmaking as world making: “No matter how weird something is, no matter how strange the world is that you’re making a film about, it’s got to be a certain way. Once you see how that is, it can’t be another way or it’s not that place anymore. It breaks the mood or the feeling.” Finally he gets in a good closing one-liner, explaining his decision to cast the unknown Jack Nance and not a name actor: “If you’re going into the netherworld, you don’t want to go in with Chuck Heston.” ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=159))
    - Note: Filmmaking is metaphysical (Richard Brody). It involves creating an entire world.
- So much about Lynch’s fraught relationship with language is summed up in that voice, in its unnervingly high volume and halting cadences. It’s clear from the 1979 footage — and from almost every interview he has done since — that words do not come easily to him. Both Lynch and his first wife, Peggy Reavey (née Lentz), have referred to his “preverbal” years, a phase that lasted into his early twenties, when he had a hard time stringing even more than a few words together. In his early short film The Alphabet, verbal learning is a source of dread: A young girl is terrorized by the letters of the alphabet as she sleeps. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=179))
- In Lynch’s own speech — and in the speech patterns of his films, with their gnomic pronouncements and recurring mantras — the impression is of language used less for meaning than for sound. To savor the thingness of words is to move away from their imprisoning nature. ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=184))
- Lynch has said, more than once, that he had to “learn to talk,” and his very particular, somewhat limited vocabulary seems in many ways an outgrowth of his aesthetic. In keeping with his interest in the intangible, he has a curious, syntactically awkward fondness for abstract nouns: “When you do something that works you have a happiness.” “It’s such a sadness that you think you’ve seen a film on your fucking telephone.” If his films swing between extreme moods, so too does the tenor of his conversation, especially when he’s discussing his work. Great ideas are “beautiful” and “thrilling” and make you “fall in love”; when the creative process is impeded, it’s a “terrible thing” that can feel “like death.” (What Lynch, a prodigious coffee drinker, lacks in eloquence, he generally makes up for with caffeinated enthusiasm.) ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=186))
- Words for him are not just reductive, they are dangerous, anathema to his view of art as fundamentally enigmatic. He says often that his films should leave “room to dream.” To decode a film, to proffer interpretations, to divulge the source of an idea — all these simply mean less room and fewer possible dreams. ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=193))
- Called upon to describe his films, Lynch typically gives the most minimal one-liners: Eraserhead is “a dream of dark and troubling things”; Inland Empire is the story of “a woman in trouble.” From as far back as Eraserhead, he was careful to seed his burgeoning legend with mysteries: He has never revealed what he used to create the movie’s mutant baby (the most popular rumor holds that it was a calf fetus). He has also claimed that Eraserhead came together in his head when he chanced upon a sentence in the Bible, while pointedly refusing to specify which one. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=196))
- While Lynch may take a hard stand against interpretation, his interpreters are legion. Despite his own reticence, there exists a proliferating cottage industry of Lynch studies, from the casual yet obsessive efforts of cultists to the more strenuous heavy lifting of scholars. No other filmmaker, save perhaps Alfred Hitchcock, has had his body of work so closely and extensively psychoanalyzed. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=213))
- Lynch has also proved irresistible to the academic discipline of cinema studies. As it became institutionalized in the 1960s and 1970s, film theory borrowed concepts from semiotics and linguistics, feminism and psychoanalysis. By the time Blue Velvet became a cultural event in 1986, postmodernism was a thriving field of study and a dominant mode of academic discourse. Rich in contradiction and mysterious in its effects, with a plot that vividly and literally dramatizes such Freudian concepts as the primal scene and the Oedipus complex, Blue Velvet opened the floodgates for Lynch studies. For many big guns of critical theory it was a dream text for analysis. The Marxist critic Fredric Jameson characterized it as a quintessential postmodern film for its nostalgic attraction to a past that never existed. Feminist theorists examined it in terms of gender and power relations. Some attacked it for misogyny; others defended it as a multilayered complication of the patriarchal “male gaze.” The first book-length scholarly study of Lynch emerged in 1993, and dozens more have surfaced since. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=221))
- Lynch sees his movies as worlds to inhabit; for devoted fans, they are often environments that encourage lingering. Twin Peaks took event television to new heights, inspiring coffee-and-cherry-pie viewing parties and fostering a community of avid interpreters, from doctoral students dissecting “the semiotics of cobbler,” as Premiere magazine snidely put it, to a zine, Wrapped in Plastic, that ran seventy-five issues, until September 2005. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=231))
- Twin Peaks was addictive not just for its tease of a drawn-out murder mystery or Lynchian oddities like a backward-talking dwarf, but also because it offered the opportunity to step into a fully imagined Pacific Northwest logging town, filled equally with unknown terrors and the comforts of the everyday: “a completely furnished world,” as the Italian philosopher Umberto Eco said, describing one precondition for a film to attain cult status. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=236))
    - Note: Last sentence
- His films are rife with the binary oppositions that underlie our dominant ways of thinking: an ideal fit for the constellation of dualisms and dialectics that are fundamental organizing principles for any number of philosophies, religions, and systems of knowledge. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=246))
- “It’s morning again in America,” goes the soothing opening line of Ronald Reagan’s best-known campaign commercial (titled “Prouder, Stronger, Better”). An uplifting paean to the ideals of marriage, family, hard work, and home ownership, this dense, minute-long montage of everyday Americans doing profoundly American things saturated the airwaves during the election season of 1984, with the economy on an upswing and patriotic sentiment cresting in anticipation of the Soviet-boycotted Los Angeles Summer Olympics. Strings swell on the sound track as a narrator trumpets low interest and inflation rates. The gauzy images promise good times on every street: A boy bikes along a sidewalk on his paper route; a nuclear family proudly carries a rolled-up rug into their picket-fenced house; children look skyward as a firefighter raises the Stars and Stripes. ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=264))
- More than fifty-four million Americans voted for Reagan in his landslide reelection over Walter Mondale that year. One of them was David Lynch, who was also twice a guest at the Reagan White House. Lynch typically avoids political statements and has described himself as a libertarian; he directed a 2000 campaign commercial for Natural Law Party candidate John Hagelin, a fellow meditator, and voiced his support for the 2012 reelection of Barack Obama, albeit strictly in terms of a deep antipathy toward Mitt Romney (“If you just rearrange a few letters, Romney becomes R MONEY. I believe Mitt Romney wants to get his Mitts on R Money”). The few times Lynch explained his support of Reagan, he provided entirely vague or superficial reasons: “I liked this one speech he read early on, at a convention.” “I mostly liked that he carried a wind of old Hollywood, of a cowboy and a brush-clearer.” ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=270))
- If the Reagan ad of two years earlier had filtered very similar images through a soft-focus lens, Blue Velvet gives them a lush, picture-book intensity, heightening the patriotic colors to the point of radioactivity. In slow motion, a beaming fireman, a Dalmatian by his side, waves from a passing fire truck; a… ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=279))
- This dementedly sunny idyll doesn’t last long. A middle-aged man in a Panama hat and sunglasses, watering his lawn, gets his hose snagged on a branch and is overcome by some kind of seizure or perhaps an insect bite, clutching his neck as he falls to the ground. Garden-hose mishaps are as old as cinema itself: For one of their first films, The Sprinkler Sprinkled, from 1895, the year of the medium’s birth, the Lumière brothers turned… ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=282))
- Lynch’s camera moves beyond this awful spectacle, pushing past the wet blades of grass to reveal, in gleaming close-up, a swarm of pitch-black beetles, as their ominous roar fills the sound track. Here, distilled down to a couple of minutes, is the story… ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=289))
- The story of the robins in Good Times on Our Street, the book that so enchanted the six-year-old David Lynch, makes no specific mention of their diet, perhaps so as not to appall its young readers. But there in plain sight, at the bottom of page 113, is an image of tenderness and revulsion, hunger and need: A robin with a wriggling worm in its beak, suspended over the open mouths of a nestful of baby robins. ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=313))
- DAVID KEITH LYNCH was born on January 20, 1946, in Missoula, the second-largest city in the northwestern state of Montana. He was the first child of Donald and Edwina “Sunny” Lynch, who met on a biology field trip as students at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina — he was studying for a master’s degree in forestry; she majored in English and foreign languages. They both served in the navy during World War II and were married in January 1945 at the naval chapel on Mare Island in California. After the war, the couple moved to Donald’s native Montana, where he started a job with the U.S. Forest Service, the agency of the Department of Agriculture that Theodore Roosevelt established to manage the country’s forest reserves. ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=318))
- Missoula, Montana, is where the forest service’s northern region has its headquarters, but Donald, who worked as a research scientist, was transferred frequently. David was only two months old when the family left Missoula for Sandpoint, Idaho, where his brother, John, was born. They moved two years later to Spokane, Washington, where the Lynches had their third child, Martha, and then to Boise, Idaho, where David attended elementary and junior high school. When David was fourteen, the family moved again, to Alexandria, Virginia, where he finished high school. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=324))
- He may have left Montana as an infant, but Big Sky Country, with its vast open spaces, lakes, and mountains, occupies a central place in David Lynch’s self-image (“Eagle Scout, Missoula, Montana”). ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=328))
- But, he adds, “you could be anywhere and see a kind of strangeness in how the world is these days, or have a certain way of looking at things.” In Twin Peaks, when Leland Palmer, revealed as his daughter’s killer, attacks the dead Laura’s look-alike cousin, Madeleine, smashing her face into a picture frame, he ushers her into oblivion with the words: “You’re going back to Missoula, Montana!” ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=335))
- “I spent a lot of time out in the woods, building fires,” Lynch recalled in a 1987 interview. (The adolescent David’s pyromanic tendencies got him arrested in Boise when he and a few friends tossed a homemade pipe bomb into their school’s swimming pool.) ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=341))
- Speaking of his childhood, Lynch has offered several variations on this quote, which in imagery and mood perfectly matches the opening of Blue Velvet: “It was beautiful old houses, tree-lined streets, the milkman, building forts, lots and lots of friends. It was a dream world, those droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees — Middle America the way it was supposed to be.” But there was also one particular cherry tree in the Lynches’ backyard in Spokane, which had “this pitch oozing out, some of it black, some of it yellow, and there were millions of red ants racing all over the sticky pitch, all over the tree. So you see, there’s this beautiful world and you just look a little bit closer, and it’s all red ants.” Elsewhere he has recast his childhood memories in explicitly cinematic terms: “I saw life in one extreme closeup shot — in one, for instance, of saliva mingled with blood — or in long shots of a peaceful environment.” ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=344))
- “I knew it as a kid but I couldn’t find the proof,” he told Chris Rodley in the book-length interview Lynch on Lynch. “It was just a feeling. There is goodness in blue skies and flowers, but another force — a wild pain and decay — also accompanies everything.” ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=361))
- Sometime in his teens, Lynch developed the habit of buttoning his shirt to the very top and even wearing two or three ties: defense mechanism disguised as eccentric fashion statement. “If my collarbone gets wind on it, it feels strange,” he once said. “I’m very insecure, and it makes me feel better to have something around my neck.” ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=376))
- He experienced the New York City subway as a Dantean inferno: “I felt I was really going down into hell . . . It was the total fear of the unknown — the wind from those trains, the sounds, the smells, and the different light and mood — that was really special in a traumatic way.” ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=386))
- At the still impressionable age of nineteen, David Lynch moved to Philadelphia, an epicenter of urban blight at the time, and a city that he would later memorialize as a veritable Gomorrah: “a very sick, twisted, violent, fear-ridden, decadent, decaying place.” ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=391))
- THE SETTING OF Eraserhead is never named but there is no mistaking this infernal wasteland for anywhere but Philadelphia — or rather, the Philadelphia of Lynch’s mind. He has jokingly called the film “the real Philadelphia Story,” and even though he made it after moving to Los Angeles, shooting in that city’s own depopulated downtown and on painstakingly fabricated sets, Eraserhead bears the imprint of Lynch’s time in Philadelphia, as a young artist on the cusp of adulthood. ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=442))
- The hapless hero of Eraserhead, Henry, with his furrowed brow and electroshock pompadour, is the first of Lynch’s many anxious protagonists. Henry’s generalized bewilderment becomes more specific with the distressing news that his estranged girlfriend, Mary, has given birth to . . . something: “They’re still not sure it is a baby!” she wails. As their offspring turns out to be a howling, pustulant monster, Eraserhead is commonly interpreted as a film about fear of fatherhood or of sex, a parable of reproductive dread. It has also become customary to bolster such readings by pointing out that Lynch became a father at age twenty-two, to a daughter who was born with club feet. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=447))
- Movies were one of the last great inventions of the industrial age, and Lynch’s cinema has always acknowledged this kinship. “No one has gotten the power in cinema that I feel there is in industry and factory workers, this notion of fire and oil,” he once said. The fixation with industry is evident throughout Lynch’s work, carrying over into the soot-stained Victorian London of The Elephant Man and the oddly mechanical future technology of Dune. ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=471))
- Whether using a paintbrush or a camera, Lynch considers his subjects, human or inanimate, for their sensual or aesthetic potential, as elements of a composition; he looks at them so intently that his gaze transfigures them. “It is ugliness on one level,” he said in a 1980 interview, referring to the squalid world of Eraserhead, “but I see it as textures and shapes, and fast areas and slow areas . . .” ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=482))
- This Lynchian perspective, seeing the world askew if not anew, goes a long way toward explaining the discombobulating effect of Eraserhead on receptive first-time viewers. One of the few sui generis movies of the last few decades, it adheres to no known conventions and never settles on a tone, poised between humor and horror, combining queasy fascination and ecstatic disgust. It faintly ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=485))
- Unlike the young turks of his generation — Lucas, Spielberg, Scorsese, Coppola, mad about movies and single-minded in their Hollywood ambitions — Lynch seemed to come from out of nowhere, from elsewhere. Self-taught and decidedly not a film buff, he arrived at cinema from an oblique angle, lacking a priori ideas about how stories should behave or what moving images can do. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=491))
- Some of the earliest drawings and paintings that Lynch produced at the academy explored curious confluences of flesh and machine. He called them “industrial symphonies” (a term he would also apply to a musical play he staged at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1990), depictions of “mechanical people,” “women who turned into typewriters.” Most emphasized deformity and prosthesis, much as Lynch’s films would, making internal organs visible and rendering biology as machinery, a system of orifices and tubes. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=510))
    - Note: Musical?
- Lynch has described Bacon as “the main guy, the number one kinda hero painter.” There are obvious affinities between Bacon’s and Lynch’s figures, which attest to the materiality and malleability of bodies. But if in the physical drama of his work Bacon pursued what the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze called “the violence of a sensation,” in Lynch’s paintings and films, the horror of mutation is usually tempered by a sensual curiosity, an implicit delight in the potential for new corporeal forms. And while Bacon fixates on man’s animal nature — our common status as meat — Lynch holds a more playful, surrealist view of biology, one in which man, animal, vegetable, and mineral exist on a continuum of matter. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=523))
- More than juvenilia, the transitional films that Lynch made in Philadelphia show him refining themes and ideas that would deepen over the years. Working across a range of media, he was also thinking through questions of form and content in ways that many young filmmakers never do. His first cinematic exercise, Six Men Getting Sick, is a clear outgrowth of his studio practice, but its closed-circuit form anticipates the temporal-loop structure that Lynch would later apply to more involved narrative films. The Alphabet, a product of Lynch’s “preverbal” phase, points to the fraught position of text and language in his work and serves as ominous foreshadowing of the serial killer’s signature in Twin Peaks, leaving lettered scraps of paper under the nails of his victims. The Grandmother is an early compendium of Lynch preoccupations, combining the biomorphic anxiety of his paintings and Eraserhead with the domestic horror of Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks.

- The Grandmother also marked the beginning of one of Lynch’s most fruitful collaborations, with the sound designer and editor Alan Splet, who had just left his job as an accountant to join a lab for industrial films in Lynch’s Philadelphia neighborhood. Lynch and Splet worked for eight weeks straight on the sound track for this wordless film, sometimes manipulating library effects but mostly creating them from scratch like foley artists in ways both primitive and ingenious. They used a golf swing for the whoosh of bedsheets being pulled back. To get a faint echo on the grandmother’s eerie whistle, they recorded Lynch whistling and, in the absence of a reverb device, rerecorded it multiple times through an aluminum duct.

    - Note: Incredible
- Lynch would often draw shapes for Splet to indicate sounds he wanted. As the ear in Blue Velvet suggests, sound is, for Lynch, the most immediate invitation into a world. Speaking of the paintings that he was creating in the late 1960s, Lynch expressed a yearning for them not simply to come to life but to become an environment that would enclose the spectator. “And you’d want the edges to disappear, and you’d want to be in there, and it would be kind of an incredible experience.” Eraserhead, for its director and many of its viewers, would come close to realizing this impossible dream.

- The AFI approved the project assuming that his twenty-one-page script would be a short film and that it would be completed in a matter of weeks. It ended up as a feature — nearly six years later. The long gestation of Eraserhead is a much mythologized chapter of independent film lore. A wholly improbable labor of love, indeed an acme of DIY monomania, it was made under circumstances that are hard to imagine any producer or film school today sanctioning.

- Eraserhead is an exemplar of ingenuity born of poverty. Lynch and his crew salvaged set dressing from swap meets and wardrobes from Goodwill. Scenery flats and even some film stock came from the Dumpsters of movie studios. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=647))
- the sheer volume of stuff that had to be constructed. Filmmaking is, for Lynch, first and foremost an exercise in world building. Nowhere has this been more literally borne out than in Eraserhead. Almost every scene features some fastidiously handcrafted object or lovingly textured surface: the planet looming behind Henry’s head in the opening shot, the twig sprouting from a hillock of earth by his bedside, the wiggling “man-made chickens” that Mr. X serves for dinner, Henry’s lopped-off head when he dreams of being decapitated, the various worm and spermatozoon-like organisms, and, of course, the moist, gauze-swaddled, pointy-headed baby itself, which Nance christened Spike, and whose origins remain a closely guarded secret to this day. Even Henry’s mushroom-cloud hairdo was a kind of living sculpture that, to Nance’s annoyance, had to be maintained for several years.

- For Lynch, comfortable in carpentry workshops and artist studios, this artisanal method was optimal. It allowed him complete control over the world of the film, as a painter would have over his canvas. ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=657))
- After he and Peggy separated in 1974, Lynch took to sleeping on the set, often having someone padlock him in from the outside so the building would look unoccupied. Henry’s room became Lynch’s as well, fulfilling the filmmaker’s vision of art as total immersion: He had created a world he could physically inhabit. Living with Eraserhead may also have brightened the film for Lynch, who discovered Transcendental Meditation during the first prolonged break.

- The ambiguous roles of the watcher and the watched are at the heart of so many Lynch films, their compounding tensions often spilling over in a literal performance on a stage, that most charged of Lynchian spaces.

- George Lucas asked if Lynch would direct the third installment of the Star Wars series, Return of the Jedi. Instead he opted to launch his own blockbuster franchise by filming one of the elusive grails of science fiction, Frank Herbert’s Dune. ([Location 861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00R6N77FK&location=861))
- It is not insignificant that many who came of age in the 1980s and 1990s — a sizable swath of Generation X — discovered Lynch in the intimate sanctums of their own living rooms or bedrooms, via a videotape of Blue Velvet or an episode of Twin Peaks. Even on a pan-and-scanned VHS cassette that cropped out more than a third of the widescreen image to fit a boxy television screen, Blue Velvet had an unnerving power. The intensity may in fact have been heightened for these unsuspecting, possibly furtive spectators, drawn to the movie’s aura of taboo, not quite knowing what they were in for.

- No less than Hitchcock’s Rear Window, Blue Velvet aligns the viewer with a voyeuristic protagonist. But the concept of complicit spectatorship, central to film theory since the 1970s, takes on shades of the uncanny here. There are moments when Blue Velvet seems to be giving shape to the unconscious of the characters — and maybe even of the audience.
