## Highlights

Life in cities is enabled by rural productiom

> The dynamics of rural China are not isolated to China itself. Yet because of its geographic distance from the United States, it remains a kind of periphery. **These rural peripheries, the edges of the world, hidden from view, enable our existence in cities**. These areas produce everything from the cotton in the clothes we wear to the minerals that create the computers in data centers. They also produce the food we eat. It is **impossible to disentangle the ==countryside== from food**—food is at the core of the dynamic between the rural and the global. As humans, we eat to survive, and our appetite for food has carved new geographies and technologies into the world. **Urbanite appetites, especially, have shifted rural economies, ecologies, and societies over the past three decades**.

China's economic regrowth is led by rural folk looking for work in cities

- Despite all these disincentives to leave, **more than three hundred million people have left their rural homes in search of work in nearby cities, creating China’s economic miracle over the past thirty years**. Such rural migrants take jobs that urbanites refuse—from making iPhones in a Foxconn factory to building the awe-inspiring Olympic architecture of Beijing. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=205))

- What China faces now is a potential “**agrarian transition**,” a term used by economists and agricultural policy makers. Agrarian transition is the process in which **farmers are pushed out of the countryside and small-scale farming is replaced by industrialized agriculture**, which requires less manual labor. As a result, there is a surplus of labor as farmers attempt to re-skill or find new jobs. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=253))
- The new socialist countryside will be filled with peasants starting e-commerce businesses, small-scale manufacturing, new data centers, and young entrepreneurial workers returning to their rural homes. **Rural Revitalization envisions the use of blockchain and mobile payment to catalyze new businesses, and will leverage big data for poverty relief and distribution of welfare benefits**. ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=271))

- home, driving down the California I-5, which cuts through the agricultural Central Valley, always reveals San Francisco as being a kind of urban delusion. Along the I-5 is a procession of Amazon fulfillment warehouses, resource extraction sites, industrial agriculture, communities ravaged by the Farm Crisis of the 1980s, and prisons—one of the biggest industries ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=282))
- China has one of the largest rates of income inequality in the world, due to the rural-urban income gap. Rural migrants work for little pay in cities but are unable to actually stay in urban areas. Yet hukou system reform is beginning, although there are new signs that rural hukou holders are less enthusiastic about switching to urban hukous. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=298))
- In his 1947 book, From the Soil, the sociologist Fei Xiaotong underscores the agricultural roots of Han Chinese culture and shows how distinct values emerged in rural areas. In Fei’s eyes, rural culture is marked by a different sense of time, a different cosmology. At the core of rural culture, he says, is a belief that the universe is already perfect as it is, and that our duty as humans is to maintain that harmony. ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=319))
- One farmer told me that the future is a created concept, and that in the fields, in the long dark of winters, there is no future, because every day depends on tending to the present moment. An act of care. In contrast, urban culture is centered on the belief that the universe must be constantly corrected on its course, and that life is defined by the pleasure of overcoming future challenges. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=323))
- In Xi Jinping’s China, it’s uncomfortable for two strangers to go too deep into the subject of zhengzhi (politics, 政治). There are no clear-cut consequences for discussing politics—after all, this is precisely how the system of censorship works, with a shadowy unease that looms over public conversations. Censorship is not made explicit; you just censor yourself. No one knows the consequences of critique, but no one wants to find out. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=409))
- Compared to countries like Mexico and Turkey, which have similar GDPs per capita, China’s food-safety index rating is significantly lower. Compared to countries like Singapore, with similarly authoritarian governments, China’s food-safety score is shockingly low. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=487))
- Feeding 22 percent of the world’s population on 7 percent of the world’s arable land is just plain difficult. ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=490))
- A large red sign across from the newly constructed hospital reads BEING LAZY IS A DISGRACE, BEING SELF-RELIANT LEADS TO STRENGTH (好吃懒惰不光彩, 自力更生才出彩). It’s one of the many political slogans that are part of the government’s poverty-alleviation policy, and eerily reminiscent of several American values: Don’t be lazy. ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=568))
  - Note: This is in one of thse poorest cities.
- When falsified records and sprawling supply chains lead to issues of contamination and food safety, blockchain seems like a clear, logical solution. ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=597))
- These chickens are delivered to consumers’ doors, butchered and vacuum sealed, with the ankle bracelet still attached, so customers can scan the QR code before preparing the chicken. Scanning this code leads them to a page with details about the chicken’s life, including its weight, the number of steps it took, and its photograph. In Shanghai, these details are seen as a sign of authenticity and food safety, while in the United States they could easily be read from an animal-welfare angle. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=628))
- In the car, driving through the small mountain paths back to the bus stop, I ask Ren, “So, what do you think of qukuailian [blockchain, 区块链]?” Although we’ve seen the GoGoChicken farm, I haven’t explicitly brought up blockchain at all during my visit. “Blockchain? What’s blockchain?” asks Ren. ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=659))
- The sentiment he shares is common among cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiasts—a cynical view of human nature, where people are selfish and untrustworthy. The idea that life is “nasty, brutish, and short” comes from the political and moral philosophy of Thomas Hobbes, who argued that a strong, authoritarian government is needed to curb the selfish instinct that lives in all of us. A few hundred years later, the “tragedy of the commons” concept would solidify Hobbes’s thinking as scientific. Many crypto and blockchain enthusiasts will cite this concept often and candidly. ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=672))
  - Note: But dont crypto libertarians want small government?
- And setting aside Hardin’s political ideologies, the tragedy of the commons theory is just plain wrong. The concept was disproved with in-depth data and careful science in 1990 by Elinor Ostrom, who would be awarded a Nobel Prize for her work. ([Location 684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=684))
- This belief in selfishness and scarcity is one of the core ideologies that gave rise to blockchain. ([Location 690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=690))
- Blockchain is a special kind of distributed record-keeping system that uses cryptography to prevent records from being falsified, eliminating the need to trust a centralized authority to verify records. ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=693))
- In blockchain, a set of records is called a block. Multiple computers, or nodes, hold a list of prior records. Each block of records is mathematically chained to the previous block of records. In order to link the blocks, a “hashing function” has to be performed by computers: guessing random numbers to solve a math problem, a task that requires enormous amounts of computing power and electricity. ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=703))
- After this hashing function, blocks are then on the blockchain, and this is transmitted to all the other computers on the network. Since the blocks are all mathematically chained together, to falsify a record would mean having to redo all the work for subsequent blocks on the chain, requiring so much electricity and resources that falsification is disincentivized. ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=707))
- This is the core of the Bitcoin blockchain. It leads with the idea that bad actors are intrinsic in a system, and to prevent their actions, enormous amounts of electricity must be spent on preventing them through hashing functions. ([Location 713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=713))
- During a long conversation with a Chinese blockchain engineer, I learn that the core belief of a government like China’s is steeped in what is termed “patriarchal authoritarianism”: its citizens cannot be trusted, so the government needs to control them. Citizens must trust that the predominantly male-led government has their best interests at heart. The government expects its citizens to believe that the system works, without question, by instilling fear that without it a few bad actors would ruin things for everyone. And so the story of blockchain in China seems like a game of pick your poison: Who do you trust more, the machine or the government? ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=724))
- One speaker at the conference, Karissa McKelvey of Digital Democracy, puts it, “Blockchain governance is not unbiased or neutral. It’s just shifting bureaucratic roles to more technical roles. At some point, you have to trust someone.” Given the demographics of those in the technical roles, McKelvey bluntly says, “You might even say it’s colonialism.” ([Location 740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=740))
- A system of record keeping used to be textual, readable, and understandable to everyone. The technical component behind it was as simple as paper and pencil. That system was prone to falsification, but it was widely legible. Under governance by blockchain, records are tamperproof, but the technical systems are legible only to a select few. ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=743))
- We operate under game theory conditions, under market forces, under the belief that we will lie to each other because someone else has more, and we have more to gain. And so we create solutions that further exacerbate this inequality. This is what happens when resources like food are treated as commodities to be bought and sold, to make money from, instead of as a basic human right. ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=771))
- Combined with genetic control, automatic feeder and water-dispenser systems, and strict exercise times, pigs are farmed to precise size. ([Location 928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=928))
- The appearance of new human diseases such as bird flu and other novel influenzas like COVID-19—zoonotic diseases that cross from animal to human—coincide with our modern era of optimizing life, of industrialized agriculture and subsequent habitat loss. The evolutionary biologist Rob Wallace has shown how this highly optimized, industrial farming of meat is leading to the unchecked creation of devastating new pathogens. For multinational agribusinesses and the governments that support them, “it pays to produce a pathogen that could kill a billion people.” A 2015 paper on zoonotic disease worriedly proclaims that 60 percent of all emerging diseases are now zoonotic, and 80 percent of new pathogens come from the top pork-producing countries—places like China. ([Location 936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=936))
- These timeshare computing setups were just as important as venture capital funding in creating the late-2010s tech boom in the United States and China—it’s estimated that 40 to 60 percent of all traceable internet traffic now comes from a rented cloud server. ([Location 982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=982))
- The old Oracle databases were replaced by Alibaba’s own framework, the Apsara framework, named after the Buddhist goddess of clouds. A towering server sits behind a glass pane, with a printed poem: CODE / LINE BY LINE / BUILDS THE FOUNDATION / FOR ETERNITY / JUST LIKE SAND / GRAIN BY GRAIN / CALMS THE ROARING SEA. Opposite the server are the first lines of code ever run on the Apsara system, configuring logging, heroically presented under a spotlight: Void InitLoggingSystem(conststd::string&configFiles=""). ([Location 989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=989))
- The logic is striking. A demand for pork drives industrialized farming of pigs, which increases disease transmission. The constant emergence of diseases drives the implementation of new technologies like AI pork farming. These technologies go on to make pork cheap, driving even more availability and demand, as people start to believe pork is a necessary part of their diet. AI is not the balm to any problem—it is just one piece of the ever-hungry quest for scale. ([Location 1022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1022))
- The philosopher and theorist Sylvia Wynter writes, “The struggle of our new millennium will be one between the ongoing imperative of securing the well-being of our present ethnoclass (i.e., Western bourgeois) conception of the human, Man.”5 Her work deconstructs the way “human” was created as a category. This concept of the “human” was tweaked throughout history to serve the projects of colonialism, slavery, racism, and subjugation. Through religious and economic institutions, the idea of who is considered human and what it means to be human has for hundreds of years been a political project by those in power. Wynter gives the example of colonial subjects and slaves being designated as nonhuman, with submission leading to salvation, allowing “inferior subjects” to become human. ([Location 1064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1064))
- I see the myth of automation replacing humans as yet another attempt by those in power to sharply define the boundaries of what being human means, elevating AI to a form of power that seems to have a righteous, natural force in our lives. ([Location 1071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1071))
- For every video camera in a public place, for every surveillance lens watching you, there’s a mirror, a screen placed for you to watch ads, cartoons, and news in a hypnotic glaze of content. More than a government conspiracy of surveillance, it ends up feeling like a hardware conspiracy to sell as many video cameras and screens as possible. ([Location 1087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1087))
- The desire for a controlled world arises from an inability to honor the unknown. “Sometimes we drug ourselves with dreams of new ideas”; we think that “the brain alone will set us free,” wrote the poet Audre Lorde in 1977. ([Location 1109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1109))
- “The white fathers told us: ‘I think, therefore I am,’” she says, referring to the Enlightenment-era philosophers who dissected knowledge as a technical, mechanical pursuit, rather than seeing forms of knowing as a reservoir of opacity, felt and lived through poetry. She asks us to move beyond dichotomies of rational versus emotional ways of knowing, for “rationality is not unnecessary … I don’t see feel/think as a dichotomy.”8 Beyond binaries, it is the place of poetry, “that back place, where we keep those unnamed, untamed longings for something different and beyond what is now called possible, to which our analysis and understanding can only build roads.” Poetry is a place of power within each of us, and poetry is “the language to express and charter this revolutionary demand, the implementation of that freedom.” ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1113))
- I think of the difference between AI helping doctors diagnose and identify disease versus AI replacing the human social service worker who determines whether someone should receive medical benefits. ([Location 1135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1135))
- Transforming work into abstract, quantifiable, optimized labor erases “any of the human and social purposes or the creative satisfactions that Work has always had in other societies.”11 It is easy to automate work using AI once you’ve made work devoid of meaning. ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1156))
  - Note: James Boggs
- He’s enormously modest, but his life might be a parable about an emerging Chinese Dream wrought by rural education and community support. It also speaks to the stark line that emerges: between those who fund code, and those who write and use code. ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1200))
- While more than 40 percent of Americans receive some kind of education after high school, only 10 percent of rural Chinese do. Even finishing high school is rare in rural China, where the dropout rate in middle school is 50 percent, and the high school dropout rate is as high as 66 percent. These rural students face the pressure of taking a job to support their families rather than spending their time in school. ([Location 1309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1309))
- Cloud computing is a nasty business. Despite its airy name, its data centers, with their numerous computer servers, rely on massive amounts of energy and resources, making up 2 percent of the world’s electricity use. That percentage is only expected to grow with increased global traffic. ([Location 1364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1364))
- Needham saw the ancient Taoism that haunted China as the problem—the sleepy Eastern belief that the universe is already perfect: we simply have to maintain the balance. This type of thinking was antithetical to the project of innovation. ([Location 1480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1480))
- The word “innovation” was derogatory in the age of monarchs, as it referred to political and economic change that could bring down empires, threatening the status of kings and elites. But slowly, throughout the Industrial Revolution, the phrase began to be seen as more positive when engineering culture took shape. In the early 1900s, Thorstien Veblen advocated the idea that technology was the output, the product of a group of male workers he termed “engineers.”1 And while engineers worked to create technology, it was the company owners, the grand industrialists, who reaped the profits of innovation. ([Location 1487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1487))
- While Asian women make up a huge portion of engineering professions in the United States, they are often left out of management and leadership roles. In fact, being Asian creates a disadvantage to becoming a leader in tech—Asians are the group least likely to be promoted from individual contributor (i.e., an engineer) to management. ([Location 1578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1578))
- In the United States, Asians are rarely seen as innovative. Because, after all, to be innovative is to be bold, daring, and brash. Within popular tech discourse, these qualities are more often ascribed to Western white men—heroic inventors with astonishing capacities, like John Galt from Atlas Shrugged. The more time I spend with Naomi, I realize: How often is it that a person of color is said to be innovating? How often in the United States do we hear about any other country innovating, especially a non-Western country? ([Location 1586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1586))
- Shanzhai holds the power to decolonize technology. For so long, technology expertise was held by a small circle, a technical elite. “Technology transfer” is the process that many development experts describe, the seeding of tech products, software, assistance, and advice from the metropolitan United States to places like China, Kenya, and even rural America. These projects have had mixed success, often leaving communities dependent on proprietary technology. But in order for technology absorption to happen, such places need the ecosystem, tools, and knowledge to begin to create their own products, tailored to their contexts. Shanzhai pushes the boundaries of what we currently think of as innovation and argues for the right not only to use a device or software but also to collaboratively alter, change, and reclaim it—a shanzhai economy instead of an innovation economy. ([Location 1626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1626))
- If innovation casts the spell of capitalism, in this mountain stronghold, I see shanzhai as a verb, used to cast a different kind of spell. To shanzhai. To turn protocols into practices that bind us together rather than centralize authority. To turn back the worship of scale and renew our commitments to care. I think back to the words I heard when I was a kid, the other magical phrase, Made in China, and the dismissive tone in the man’s voice. Barometers of success and innovation are invented by those with money, turning engagement into the surface-level interactions of informed users, rather than the deeper actions that tackle structural, social change by invested citizens willing to hold long village meetings. Entire entrepreneurship programs exist, funded by VCs, designed to foster what VCs see as the core values of innovation. Instead of continuing to accept success and innovation as empty containers, I propose new measures, understanding our world through shanzhai, through the ability to care, maintain, renew, and deepen commitments. ([Location 1680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1680))
- Like capitalism and the free market, China’s models of policing have been based on U.S. models. Chinese police academy exchange students have ended up at Sam Houston State University in Texas, and the Los Angeles police even proudly tout “Police Diplomacy,” citing the number of police exchange visits between China and L.A. ([Location 1752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1752))
- All this information sits in a database, a hulking engineering marvel that underpins so much of our modern world. Databases allow people to read, write, update, and destroy data in a fairly dependable way. They also require the people who build databases to form strong opinions about the world and the way it’s structured. For example, the attributes of a user on a platform are dictated by columns an engineer defines in the database. Different databases have different logics for the way data must be formatted, which in turn shapes the way we have come to encode the world. ([Location 1796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1796))
  - Note: \*\* fascinating point. Never thought of that befoore
- For Xiaoli, the difficulties of creating data emphasize not only how important data is but how it doesn’t just appear out of thin air, extracted by technology. Data needs to be collected, chased down, massaged, tidied. Which means that the collection of data and the design of a database are intentional: the dimensions of data that need to be collected, defined by a database, already imbue a vision of how a world should be turned granular. Like the translating of a human life into columns and rows, any image of an object is simply a representation of the object. No matter what you use to photograph an object, the image remains a grainy approximation. ([Location 1817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1817))
- Beyond recognizing parts of faces, the algorithm can start to discern characteristics about you, characteristics to classify you—the distance between your eyes, or the width of your chin. These distances are compared to the average set of collected measurements in order to make categorical assumptions about you—whether you’re looking happy or sad that day, or even more troubling judgments. ([Location 1889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1889))
  - Note: !
- In one corner of the Megvii showroom is a display about Meitu, the beauty and cosmetics app with which you can quickly edit your selfies. The commercial is cheerful: a woman gives herself bunny ears, some blush, and lipstick. She makes herself a little paler, her eyes a little bigger, as is the fashion in East Asia—“Caucasian” features are seen as beautiful. These beauty standards, accelerated by convenient beauty app face filters, are evident in the plastic surgery ads that have now overtaken Chinese cities, which feature brown-haired, dewy-skinned white women with the ever-coveted nose bridge. ([Location 1918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1918))
- It’s an enormously popular delivery app in China, and heralded as one of the latest innovations in China speed, a frenetic pace made possible by complex logistical coordination, the brute force of cheap labor, and the availability of low-cost mobile phones. Gone are the days of riffling through vegetables at the market, batting away old women at the store in a rush for the best produce. Everything from medicine to cooked meals and vegetables can now be delivered to you via [[Meituan]], or scheduled to arrive at your door when you get home from work. Chinese cities are now crowded with an army of yellow-uniformed delivery drivers, riding electric scooters that weave through dense traffic and bike lanes. ([Location 1939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1939))
- On the wall, recruitment flyers are tacked everywhere. The salary breakdown is also posted on the wall. Unlike most gig economy drivers in the United States, Meituan couriers are paid a base salary of RMB 2,000 (US$280) a month. ([Location 1965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1965))
- Everything else listed on the salary breakdown sheet is a fine. Being late for a delivery incurs an RMB 5 fine. A bad review costs the driver an RMB 20 fine. Refusing to take an order after it is assigned in the system results in an RMB 100 fine, and being too early for a delivery is a whopping RMB 500 fine. ([Location 1968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=1968))
  - Note: !
- Yet I long for a leap, for us to reconsider how surveillance has been made into a moral imperative in policing, how somehow the police state has been naturalized. Surveillance has never just been about crime, as historians and scholars like Simone Browne have shown, and it is in fact deeply tied to race, ethnicity, and white supremacist constructions of criminality. Just as platforms off-load risk onto gig economy workers, unchecked capitalism creates economic inequality and off-loads the risks and fears onto us all. ([Location 2017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2017))
- In order for us to challenge surveillance, we will have to move beyond corporate, profit-driven platforms that track us and monetize our data, but more importantly we will have to combat our own fears and illusions of safety. We must question the culture of surveillance and carceral punishment that condition us to think living with fear is the only way of understanding we are alive. ([Location 2021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2021))
- This work is deeply tied to transformative justice and the work of prison abolition. Until we do this work, we will not be able to move past surveillance as normalized activity and we will not be able to adequately advocate for the right to privacy for all. ([Location 2026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2026))
- I don’t want to live in a world where privacy is declared a human right only for a category of humans like me, and not for others. And this right to privacy is not an individualistic one of secrets and stories, but a social one that requires us to lead with trust in our daily lives. ([Location 2032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2032))
  - Note: Important distinction
- Data cannot truly represent the full spectrum of life. It remains a thin slice of the world. There is always some kind of bias built in. Yet we imagine numbers to mean something, and this creates a common tendency that the statistician Philip B. Stark calls “quantifauxcation”: the attempt to assign numbers or quantify phenomenon, as if quantitative data can offer certainty.4 Some strategies for quantifauxcation, says Stark, include saying things people want to believe, and adding opaque complexity to models, since complexity has become conflated with accuracy.

- In that time of tumult, questions of what it meant to live, and what it meant to be human, were at the forefront of many people’s minds, like Fanon’s, as they worked together to build new societies. Living against history can equally be applied to our understanding of data—“I am not a prisoner of history. I should not seek there for the meaning of my destiny. I should constantly remind myself that the real leap consists in introducing invention into existence. In the world through which I travel, I am endlessly creating myself.” ([Location 2063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2063))
- Dinglou village is a successful e-commerce town, tucked into the flat, dusty plains of Shandong. Its success shows in the restaurants, the paved roads, the bustling morning market, and even the village ghosts ([Location 2184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2184))
- In rural Taobao land, there is no government, just the rules of Taobao. Alibaba makes a range of platforms, including 1688.com (the digits when said out loud in Chinese sound like “Alibaba”), a domestic site for bulk purchases. But Alibaba is most well-known for Taobao.com, a huge e-commerce site that allows small businesses and individuals to sell directly to consumers. All the goods are new, and some of them are homemade. As of 2017, Taobao had six hundred million monthly active users, compared to Amazon’s three hundred million monthly active users. ([Location 2195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2195))
- The narrator describes how in 2013 the internet giant Alibaba launched the Rural Taobao strategy, aimed at improving the lives of those in rural China. It’s as if Google decided to turn itself into a branch of the United Nations, or as if Amazon decided it suddenly wanted to offer assistance to an Appalachian coal-mining town by helping its citizens start candy businesses and giving them Amazon-backed loans. ([Location 2204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2204))
- The strategy is two-pronged: Rural Taobao and Taobao villages. The first involves a series of Rural Taobao Service Centers, which are usually located at the village convenience stores and revolve around one URL: cun.taobao.com. At these Rural Taobao Service Centers, Taobao contracts with one or two local villagers as brand ambassadors. ([Location 2207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2207))
- Shopping is the main highlight of rural Taobao, but digital literacy is also emphasized. In the rural Taobao world, “digital” means anything Alibaba-related. Villagers may not be buying gold lighters anytime soon, but practical goods like laundry detergent and long underwear are popular with rural users on the site. ([Location 2211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2211))
- This is the ambitious part of the Alibaba Rural Taobao Strategy: rural economic growth. It involves planting the seeds for a Taobao village. A Taobao village is a place where more than 10 percent of the village households are manufacturing at home for Taobao.com. To accomplish this, Alibaba has a whole branch of its company focused on rural development, rural finance, and rural Taobao. It also has its own rural research institute, AliResearch, which examines the business cycles of Taobao villages to understand their successes and failures. ([Location 2217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2217))
- Dinglou was officially designated by Alibaba in 2012 as the first Taobao village. Since then, the number of Taobao villages has soared from 1,311 in 2016 to 3,202 across twenty-four provinces in China in 2018. ([Location 2221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2221))
- One official document from Dinglou boasts that five hundred college students have returned home because of the thriving e-commerce, which is a population boom for a village. It brings talent and knowledge back to the countryside, and ensures that the countryside will also develop, instead of growth concentrating in cities.

- It’s no wonder the Rural Revitalization document of the Chinese Communist Party is exuberantly betting on e-commerce. The internet promised disembodiment, but the internet has never been more material. The notion of discrete physical and digital worlds is nothing but a convenient fiction.

- The global reach of drop-shipping is born out of Alibaba and AliExpress, allowing drop-shipping entrepreneurs access to millions of items, shipped at low cost, directly from China. There are numerous online articles about how to start a profitable drop-shipping business, and many of these businesses are responsible for the deluge of Instagram ads that you see: lifestyle brands selling sleek water bottles, new travel bags, and suitcases. These items are often from AliExpress: drop-shippers simply provide the advertising and marketing. ([Location 2329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2329))
- It feels bizarre: a group of children trick-or-treating in suburban America is fueling the growth of fruit trees and chili peppers in Shandong, and also driving land rentals. The internet is tangibly reshaping Dinglou’s environment. ([Location 2337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2337))
- Shopping has made consumption the site of political action rather than the enemy of it. Although many of us have jobs that keep us occupied, the real work we do these days is shopping, and especially shopping online. Economists across the world make it clear that we are in a consumer-driven economy. Shopping is an ecstasy-inducing act, a brief tease that allows us to brush up against the life we desire, that we feel like we deserve. So much exists in the service of shopping, one of the world’s biggest religions. Modern corporate social media is born out of shopping—it fills our screens, bits of news and personal announcements interspersed with ads, enrapturing us into a ludic loop. Machine-learning algorithms hum along to recommend better items. ([Location 2396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2396))
- Matilda, the founder of Bits x Bites, had put it this way: If big companies like Nabisco symbolized the nineties, hundreds of smaller, fragmented companies will dominate the future, catering to a continuum of different tastes and experiences. And this landscape of smaller companies is what some people see as part of “the New Retail.” ([Location 2419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2419))
  - Note: Fascinating
- Yet we chase after this dream, some of us styling ourselves and our homes to reflect the life we aspire to, while plunging ourselves into debt, losing relationships to overworking. This isn’t just in the United States—it’s in China too, where millennials have nearly doubled the country’s household debt through aspirational spending. ([Location 2429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2429))
- At the drop of a pin they can demand a refund, and because of the escrow service, the money gets sent back to them, even if I’ve shipped the order already. Or maybe they don’t like the material, they think it’s cheap. But we have to keep on making worse-quality stuff. How are we supposed to keep prices low and also compete with others? The government thinks it’s great and keeps doing things like building roads, putting in broadband. And Alibaba uses all this infrastructure for free, relies on us to make decisions on lowering the quality of goods. But what happens next? There’s only so much cutting corners we can do. There’s only so many ads we can buy, lies about the products we can say. What happens when this system fails?” ([Location 2444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2444))
- These processes that enable companies to run lean draw upon gemba kaizen, or the art of continuous improvement, pioneered by Japanese management consultants. Gemba kaizen emphasizes cutting away waste, and ensuring that workers and managers are aligned, decreasing miscommunications and wasted time, known as “thrash.” Originally used as a working process in Japanese manufacturing, agile methods in software are now spilling back over into other industries.

- Southern China is notorious for not having central heating. It was an arbitrary city-planning decision made back in the 1950s, for northern China to have central heating provided by the government, but southern China to be left to its own devices.1 The government recently decided to crack down on air pollution in an attempt to build an “ecological civilization,” so cheap coal heating is being replaced with natural gas or electric heaters. Wages remain low in the countryside, and household heating is a luxury.2 Zhao’s office is especially cold today, after yesterday’s snowfall.

- Zhuji is proud of its status as a pearl city, and it even includes the Angel’s Tears Pearl Museum. Like Shenzhen’s Huaqiangbei for electronics, Zhuji’s pearl market is a dizzying array of stalls and booths. The pearl market is filled with the loud noises of yelling and bargaining, bright fluorescent lights, and pearls everywhere. Handbags made of pearls, pearl necklaces, pearls by the ton.

- KOLs have been sprouting up all over China’s internet in the past few years. While KOLs have long-standing “expertise” in some kind of subject matter, like lipstick or cars, a related category of online personas, wanghong (网红), has also appeared, as more generic influencers. KOLs and wanghong are everywhere on China’s widely used video apps. In urban areas, KOLs are glossy Chinese equivalents of Instagram celebrities and influencers. Minimalist coffee shops, Prada purses, boho clothing, and red lipstick abound on Xiao Hong Shu (Little Red Book, 小红书), an app filled with shopping and lifestyle images. Between Guangzhou and San Francisco, there’s an emerging global aesthetic of what it means to live a luxe life these days.

- Livestreaming is one of them. Platforms and apps like Kuaishou (literally translated as “Fast Hands”) feature people hawking all kinds of goods: oranges, glass beads, visits to a countryside home, and perfume, just to name a few. ([Location 2813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2813))
- Kuaishou’s meteoric rise as one of the most popular apps in China is due precisely to its stronghold in rural areas. A large-scale study on Kuai by the anthropologist Chris Tan shows that Kuaishou’s users are typically under twenty-five, without a college degree, living in rural or low-tier cities. They are usually unemployed or hold low-paying jobs, earning less than RMB 3,000 a month, as rural migrants or farmers.

- Peppa Pig lives a double life in China. She’s on cups and T-shirts, promoting delicious cookies for children and teaching kids how to be nice. On the internet, Peppa Pig is a rallying cry for disenfranchised youth. She is a meme, an online symbol for a growing group of people who believe the dominant system of society not only has no place for them, but also that, deep down, the system is rigged. Behind the memes of Peppa is not only a defeated irony but an anarchic embrace of “antisocial” behavior. ([Location 2844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2844))
- Peppa Pig is a symbol co-opted by shehui ren, a recent term coined on livestream, that translated literally means “society person.” “Society person” describes the bulk of Kuai’s demographic: people who are unable to live the shiny, upper-middle-class life promised to them in advertisements throughout China. ([Location 2848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2848))
- Instead of abiding by this prescribed life, shehui ren have no desire to enter the competitive whirl of school and employment; they see through the expectations of society. And the government sees this kind of nihilism as troubling, both socially and economically. ([Location 2855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2855))
- Censors and state sources explicitly cited Peppa Pig’s shehui ren culture as leading to antisocial behavior, “which could potentially hamper positive societal growth.” ([Location 2859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2859))
- want to skip: the work of building a community upheld by boundlessness and belonging, a sense of purpose beyond reducing work and life to simple economics. I think of the Peppa Pig meme and how strong a new community’s culture can grow, aided by symbols. It’s easy to mistake the power of the Peppa Pig meme as simply resulting from the internet. But culture and community, not technology, are the driving force behind its power, its threat to the elite. As internet researchers such as An Xiao Mina and sociologists have shown, the driving force behind broader sociopolitical change has always been culture, with or without the internet.7 Cultural change comes before political change, and that cultural change starts with us. It is up to us to make meaning, to make new symbols. ([Location 2939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2939))
- But I am less curious about this stifling singularity and more curious about the revealed state of “interbeing”: a term the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh uses to replace the simple binary of being and nonbeing. ([Location 2970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084M1SVMC&location=2970))
- The present moment promises nothing—it only demands. It demands building the communities that shift culture, that allow interbeing to thrive. It demands the work of awareness and care, instead of the tools of efficiency and scale. It demands seeing individual freedom as nothing more than a way for all of us to be oppressed. Most of all, the present demands the tender, honest work of attempting to make meaning, instead of looking, waiting, or wanting. Through the present moment I see the glimmers of liberation embedded in the work we must do at this time. Because what else can we do?
