Term of art that I'm using, in contrast to David Sparks idea of "[[Contextual Computing]]", which refers to DIY, hobby level computing.

If you know just enough programming, you can make programs and apps for yourself and for your loved ones that are unique. They don't need to be sold or shared. Robin Sloan had written of the app as a "[home-cooked meal](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/)".

It's computing at a wildly different scale: inverting the traditional small-to-scale path.

(robin sloan) that work for you. you're computer experience is totally customized for you. (mcphee does this with kedit, see [[2021-12-08-19-30-47 mcphee]]).

My system is filled with custom made alfred workflows that are designedjust for my system. Some might generalize, but that's not the point.

Aim is to make computer be a joyful external tool for thought, not something you work *against*.
