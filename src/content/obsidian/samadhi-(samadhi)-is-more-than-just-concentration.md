Sanskrit term in Buddhism translating, very loosely, to a state of concentration. But that Western definition doesn't convey the fullness of samadhi, as Rob Burbea rightly points out.

More importanyly, it's a **harmonizing** and unifying of the internal energies of the mind and body; there's a richness and beauty in it that narrow "concentration" doesn't capture.

A skilled meditation practice involves a cultivation and *caring* for samadhi. It's not meant as an "achievement". We want to care for the heart and mind. When we hang out in this space, it's unbelievably nourishing for the mind. We see, indeed, that "happiness is possible for us in this life" (Burbea, Loc 911)

Instead here we will emphasize that ==what characterizes states of sam훮dhi is some degree of **collectedness and unification of mind and body in a sense of well-being**==. Included in any such state will also be some degree of ==**harmonization of the internal energies** of the mind and body==
