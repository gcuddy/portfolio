# Capital: a critique of political economy

- [[harveymarx2010 A companion to Marx's Capital]]

## Notes

Translation of: Das Kapital Vol. &lt;3 &gt; translated by David Fernbach

## Notes on volume 1 of Capital

### introduction

This is not a book of "pure" economic theory - it's about capitalist mode of production! For Marx, abstract pure economic theory is not possible!



### Section 1

Important framing: Marx is discussing capitalist societies in pure form â€” not socialism, ancient societies, etc.

Wealth in **capitalist societies** is a collection of commodities, so Marx starts with an analysis of the commodity:

- It's an external object, thing which somehow satisfies a human need![[20230612111008 PDF Expert screenshot.jpg]]
From Harvey: "All he is interested in is the simple fact that people buy commodities and that this act is foundational to how people live"

- Quality and quantity make up two points of view for every sueful thing
- usefulness of a thing makes it a ==use-value==
	- usevalues are only realized (verwirklicht) in use or in consumption

Commodities are essentially all products of human labor.
commodities are "reduced to the same kind of labour, human labour in the abstract"

Struggling over this line a bit:
![[20230612112557 PDF Expert screenshot.jpg]]
I believe Marx is saying that, essentially, usefulness is sort of a moot point in capitalism. (see:: [[Capitalism artificially reduces usefulness]]). Since profit is the only thing that matters in capitalism (see:: [[the primary value of capitalism is profit]]), we're left solely with exchange-value (which depends solely on quantity, not quality). This could be e.g. consumerist trash

![[20230612112914 PDF Expert screenshot.jpg]]

- Okay, reading this nwo along with David Harvery's companion guide

Great passage:
![[20230612114800 PDF Expert screenshot.jpg]]

Exchange value is the represesntation of human labor, as in the prices at the supermarket. But the embodiment of human labore has that "phantom-like" presence


Connect this ieda (129) with [[Technology under capitalism does not reduce labor time and thus is not a liberatory force]] (from [[ð– « This Life - Martin HÃ¤gglund]])

Definition of [[socially necessary labor time]]

![[20230612140923 Preview screenshot.jpg]]

**Concept of value is dynamic**, here's Harvey: 
> Transformations in the natural environment or migration to places with more favorable natural conditions (cheaper resources) revolutionize values. Commodity values, in short, are subject to a powerful array of forces. He does not here attempt a definitive categorization of all of them; he simply wants to alert us that what we are calling "value" is not a constant, but is subject to perpetual revolutionary transformations.


Things can be use-values without being a value:
> A thing can be a use-value without being a value. This is the case whenever its utility to man is not mediated through labour. Air, virgin soil, natural meadows, unplanted forests, etc. fall into this category.

Is this similar to the area of freedom that Hagglund talks about? We do plenty of things under capitalism (like grow plants) that are useful but not commodity values.

This diagram from Harvey is helpful:

### Section 2

I know we're going to get there, but all this talk about labor and commodities is applicable to material goods but makes me wonder about things like services, and then things like labor and technology or digital artifacts / (what about digital courses lol)![[20230613225818 Preview screenshot.jpg]]

## Chapter 2: The Process of Exchange

![[20230624231139 Obsidian screenshot.jpg]]

Commodities are things â€” they can be possessed by man, either voluntarily or by force. Guardians of commodities thus recognize each other as owners of private property.

For the owner, a commodity possesses no direct use-value. Rather, he must bring it to market and its only use-value is as a bearer of exchange value (via means of exchange)
> All commodities are non-use-values for their owners, and use-values for their non-owners. Consequently, they must all change hands.

So commodities must be realized as values before they can be realized as use-values (because they're exchanged in relation with other values). But they also must stand test as use-value before being a value. (Dialectical tensinnnn)

> Money necessarily crystallizes out of the process of exchange, in which different products of labour -are in fact equated with each other, and thus converted into commodities. The historical broadening and deepening of the phenomenon of exchange deÂ­ velops the opposition between use-value and value which is latent in the nature of the commodity. ([[marxfowkes1981 Capital.pdf#page=179&annotation=42413R|181]])

Every other commodity is particular equivalent to owner â€” owner's is universal equivalent. But this applies to all owners, so no actual universal. Thus we need money form.

Commodities alienate us from each other:  ([[marxfowkes1981 Capital.pdf#page=180|182]])
![[20230624231835 Highlights screenshot.jpg]]

We choose precious metals (gold or silver) as form of appearance of value because of uniform quality, and quantitative differentiation: (184)
![[20230624231941 Highlights screenshot.jpg]]

Money is not a mere symbol:
![[20230624232016 Obsidian screenshot.jpg]]

Money cannot truly express value!
![[20230624232214 Highlights screenshot.jpg]]

We ultimately relate to each other in an atomistic way

![[20230624232259 Highlights screenshot.jpg]]


## Chapter 3

Marx is concerned here with money and the circulation of exchange.

> [!quote] Critical framing from [[harveymarx2010 A companion to Marx's Capital]] on this whole chapter:
> 
> > So Marx contrasts money as a measure of value (section 1) and money as a means or medium of circulation (section 2). At the end of the day, though, there is only one kind of money (section 3). ==And the resolution of that tension between money as an effective measure of value and money as an efficient means of circulation is partially given by the possibility, or-and this is controversial-the necessity, of another form of circulation, which is the existence of credit moneys==. The consequent relation between debtors and creditors opens up not only the possibility but also the necessity for another form of circulation, that of capitaL In other words, what emerges in this chapter is the possibility for the concept, as well as the fact, of capitaL ==In the same way that the possibility of money crystallized out of processes of exchange, so the **possibility of capital crystallizes out of the contradiction between money as the measure of value and money as the means of circulation**. This is the big story in this long chapter==. If you keep it steadily in mind, a lot of the intricate and sometimes confusing details fall more easily into place.

![[Mapping Marx's Argument in Volume 1 of Capital.excalidraw#^area=b7J6kP0OGPZ1Nti43hJtF]]

Money contains dual character: as a measure of value (efficient) and as a means of circulation (inefficient). The resolution of that tension into one kind of money is given by  the necessity of **credit money** (and thus creditors and debtors). (Does this open up a connection to [[Graeber Debt]]?). This relation of debtors and creditors opens up t he necessity of another form of circulation: **capital**.

![[Mapping Marx's Argument in Volume 1 of Capital.excalidraw#^area=LofO6wDjVsrAIrqZh_NEA]]

So the possibility of capital crystallizes out of contradiction bnetween money as measure of value and as means of circulation (just as money crystallized out of processes of exchange).

### Section 1

- Received price is *appearance* of value

Marx makes clear that when gold changes values (which it does all the time) its  inconstancy makes no difference to the *relative* values of the commodites being exchanged in the marketplace. See page 192 ("when we are dealing with prices we are only concerned with the relation between different quantities of gold")

"money-names of the metal weights are gradually sepaÂ­rated from their original weight-name"

via harvey: One of the state's most important functions, as we will see, has to do with organizing the monetary system, regulating the money-names and keeping the monetary system effective and stable.

These historical processes have made the separation of the money-name from the weight-name into a fixed popular custom. Since the standard of money is on the one hand purely conventional, while on the other hand it must possess universal validity, it is in the end regulated by law. (194)

But this money-name is a fetish-construct! ("I know nothing of a man if I merely know his name is Jacob" (195)):
![[Marx - Capital - Page 195.jpg]]
 )105_
"Price is the money-name of the labour objectified in a commodity". 
In other words:
Price = money-name of labor embodied in a commodity

This section is crucial ([[marxfowkes1981 Capital.pdf#page=195|197]]), and if Marx were writing today he's want to elaborate. 
> The price-form, however, is not only compatible with the posÂ­ sibility of a quantitative incongruity between magnitude of value and price, i.e. between the magnitude of value and its own exÂ­ pression in money, but it may also harbour a qualitative contradicÂ­ tion, with the result that price ceases altogether to express value, despite the fact that money is nothing but the value-form of comÂ­ modities. ==Things which in and for themselves are not commodiÂ­ ties, things such as conscience, honour, etc., can be offered for sale by their holders, and thus acquire the form of commodities through their price. Hence a thing can, formally speaking, have a price without having a value==. The expression of price is in this case imaginary, like certain quantities in mathematics. On the other hand, the imaginary price-form may also conceal a real value-relation or one derived from it, as for instance the price of uncultivated land, which is without value because no human labour is objectified in it. ^t889o1



197, harvey: 
> Once you can hang a price tag on something, you can in principle put a price tag on anything, including conscience and honor, to say nothing of body parts and children. You can hang it on a natural resource, on the view of a waterfall; you can certainly put a price tag on land and speculate on shifts in land prices. The price system can operate in these other dimensions to produce qualitative as well as quantitative incongruities. Which then raises the question: if prices can be put on anything independently of their value, and if they can in any case quantitatively fluctuate all over the place independently of value, then why is Marx so fixated on the labor theory of value? Aren't the conventional political economists-even to this day-correct to say that all we can observe and all that can have real meaning is contained in the concept of price, and that the labor theory of value is therefore irrelevant?

So why the labor theory of value at all? Since price can operate in any dimension?
Harvey:
> the question ofwhere everybody's breakfast comes from, as well as the electronics, the paper, the automobiles, the houses and the highways that sustain daily life. To pretend this all arrives magically through the market, facilitated by the magic of the money that happens to be in our pocket, is to succumb totally to the fetishism of the commodity. We need the concept of value as socially necessary labor-time in order to break through the fetishism.

### Section 2

important phrase: "the form within which [contradictions] have room to move".

Marx is showing that we have a perpetual expanding of contradictions

As Harvey points out, some people like to think about dialectic as being strictly thesis, antithesis, synthesis. They might say that "we have money" that's a nice synthesis, thank god. No â€” we now have to go analyze contradictions that money-forms internalize. ==Thus Marx's dialectic is not closed â€” it's constantly expanding==. 

In this section we get Marx's critical [[C-M-C]] process: commodities exchanged fro money used to buy more commodities. 

This is not symmetrical: 

> At the heart of Marx's objection to Say's law lies the following argument. I start with C, I go to M, but there is no force that compels me to spend the money immediately on another commodity.

Critical, from Harvey
> ![[20230701212134 Preview screenshot.jpg]]

Keynes in 1936 abandons Say's Law with General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money.

Keynes liquidity trap: some ruction occurs, those with money get nervous and hold on to it, driving demand for C down. K says gov has to step in with fiscal stimuli.

Interesting: so Keynes says he never read Marx (but he probably did). Keynesian thinking dominated economy until anti-K revolution of late 70s and thus rise of [[neoliberalism]] (close to an acceptance of say's law).

Marx points out three factors:
> These three factors, the movement of prices, the quantity of commodities in circulation, and the velocity of cirÂ­ culation of money, can all vary in various directions under differÂ­ ent conditions. Hence the sum of the prices to be realized, and consequently the quantity of the circulating medium conditioned by that sum, will vary with the very numerous variations of the three factors in combination. Here we shall outline only the most importantvariations in the history ofcommodity prices.

Gov goes through great pains to get accurate measurements on that "velocity of money" idea.

Brilliant imagery from Marx here on the state replacing metallic money commodities with tokens

### Section 3

My first read-thru notes:

Marx starts by discussing hoarding. Commodities are sold to obtain the money-form, which becomes an end in itself. Indeed, the money "is petrified into a hoard, and the sller of commodities becomes a hoarder of monety" (228).

Every sum of money is limited, and therefore has limited efficacy. Thus we have a "contradiction between the quantitative limitation and the qualitative lack of limitation of money keeps driving the hoarder back to his Sisyphean task: accumulation" (231). In other words, an insatiable (libidinal?) drive to accumulate. 

In order to hoard, it must be prevented from circulating. Here's a line that confirms my libidinal impulse: "The hoarder therefore sacrifices the lusts of his flesh to the fetish of gold" (231). So "work, thrift and greed" become this person's cardinal virtues: sell more, buy little.

Marx points out that the aesthetic possession of commodities made of gold and silver is a direct correlation to hoarding.

I'm not entirely clear on how hoarding creates the reserves for circulation that Marx talks about on 231-232.

b) means of payment

Marx starts to outline an idea of credit here, using the exampleof houses, where a use-value is not realized till the lease is expired. The seller sells an existing commodity, and the buyer buys as the "representative of future money" â€” in other words, a creditor and a debtor.

Marx points out crises occur when payments have to be made and money doesn't circulate. (235)

238: Thus credit money springs out of money as a means of payment. Debt circulates.

marx says hoarding disappears with bougeous so i'm confused

c) woirld money

When money leaves domestic spehere it loses local functions and falls back to being original, global form as precious metal in shape of bullion.

Gold and silver both are standards on world market, Marx says

World means is the univerasal and absolute materialization of wealth

Predominant function is as "means of payment in the settling of international balances. Hence the slogan of the Mercantile system: balance of rade."

Function of hoards comes out of need of international reserves

"Countries with developed bourgeous production limit the hoards concentrated in the strong rooms of the banks to the minimum required for the performance of their specific functions".

-- 2023-07-02 18:41  phew! done with my first read-thru of this chapter, which is interesting but quite a struggle to get through. looking forward to the rest of the book, which supposedly gets lighter! going to finish the harvey chapter and watch his lecture on 2 and 3 before continuing!

Harvey points out that the line about money benig a commodity in itself, and thus "an external object capable of becoming the private property of any individual" is critical.

Harvey points to the accumulation bit and makes the same connectinos I do about billionaires (73). No matter how much money they earn, billionaires want (and can get) more. Thus shows that capitalism is characterized by constant and seemingly limitless growth. (I wonder if Saito draws on this for his degrowth Marx arguments? There's certainly an argument to be made here that Marx is pointing out that there is ==a specific type of growth unique to capitalism that is a problem==. )

Rest of observations here are by way of Harvey:

The roles of creditors and debtors results from circulation, but Marx notes it's possible for these roles to shift from transient to "a more rigid crystallization". In other words: a definite class relation.

From the perspective of the creditor, we have M-C-M. I give you money with the idea that I will get it back later. But why? Well, Marx doesn't make it clear yet, but it's clear: to get back more money.

This is a crucial passage, Harvey says:

> Let us return to the sphere of circulation. The two equivalents, commodities and money, have ceased to appear simultaneously at the two poles of the process of sale. The money functions now, first as the measure of value in the determinat!on of the price of the commodity sold . . . Secondly it serves as a nominal means of purchase. Although existing only in the promise of the buyer to pay, it causes the commodity to change hands. Not until payment falls due does the means of payment actually step into circulation, i.e. leave the hand of the buyer for that of the seller. The circulating medium was transformed into a hoard because the process stopped short after the first phase, because the converted shape of the commodity was withdrawn from circulation. The means of payment enters circulation, but only after the commodity has already left it. The money no longer mediates the process. It brings it to an end by emerging independently, as the absolute form of existence of exchange-value, in other words the universal commodity. The seller turned his commodity into money in order to satisfy some need; the hoarder in order to preserve the monetary form of his commodity, and the indebted purchaser in order to be able to pay. If he does not pay, his goods will be sold compulsorily. The value-form of the commodity, money, has now become the self-sufficient purpose of the sale, owing to a social necessity springingfrom the conditions oftheprocess ofcirculation itself. (233-4, emphasis added)

Marx is saying that there needs to be a form of circulation in which money is going to be exchanged in order to get more money: M-C-M.  Thus we have a critical distinction. Harvey:

> ==If the objective is procuring other use-values through commodity production and commodity exchange==, albeit mediated through money, we're dealing with C-M-C. In contrast, ==M-C-M is a form of circulation in which money is the objective==, not commodities. In order for that to have a rationale, it ==requires that I get back more money than I started with==. This is the moment in *Capital* when we first see ==the circulation of capital crystallizing out of the circulation of commodities mediated by the contradictions of money-forms==. There is a ==**big difference between the circulation of money as a mediator of commodity exchange and money used as capital**==. ==**Not all money is capital**==. A monetized society is not necessarily a capitalist society. ==If everything revolved around the C-M-C circulation process, then money would be merely a mediator, nothing more. Capital emerges when money is put into circulation in order to get more money.==

--

Harvey now pauses to reflect: is the argument so far historical or logical? In other words, is the proliferation of commodity exchange necessarily leading to rise of money-form and the internal contradiction within these leading to the rise of capitalist form of circulation (where money is used to gain more money) inherent to the teleology of history, or a logical argument?

Harvey says it's not historical: this is not an ineveitable step in human history emerging out of gradual prolifierations of commodity exchange.

The logical rational ie more persuasive: it's the methodology at work â€” the dialectical and relational oppositions. 

> It focuses on the methodology at work as the argument unfolds: the dialectical and relational opposition between use-value and exchange-value as embodied in the commodity; the externalization of that opposition in the money-form as a way to represent value and facilitate commodity exchange; the internalization of this contradiction by the money-form as both a medium of circulation and a measure of value; and the resolution of that contradiction through the emergence of relations between debtors and creditors in the use ofmoney as a means of payment. Now we are in a position to understand money as the beginning and end point of a distinctive circulation process, to be called capital.

Marx's argument turns here: you can't settle bills with more IOUS  â€” you've got to find hard cash (236). 

![[202307021909 Preview - harveymarx2010_A companion to Marx's Capital.pdf screenshot.jpg]]

([[Crises are inherent to capitalism]]. Money doesn't matter, until it does.)

Does this have anything to do (particualrly Harvey's example on page 80 of companies in East Asia in 1997-98 being heavily indebted â€” but could have easily worked their way out if it had not been for sudden withdrawl of short-term liquidity. Bankers withdrew, economy craswhed, companies went bankrupt, and then they had to sell to wall street.)

The Federal Reserve is modern-day version of Marx's idea of reserve fund.

Harvey concludes with discussion of move away from Gold standard:

> All that has happened since 1973 is that the manner of representation has changed. But Marx himself also notes multiple shifts in representational forms with coins, paper moneys, credit and the like, so in a way there is nothing in the current situation that defies his mode of analysis. What has happened, in effect, is that the value of a particular currency vis-a.-vis all other currencies is (or should be) determined in terms of the value of the total bundle of commodities produced within a national economy. Plainly, the overall productivity of a whole economy is an important variable in all this; hence the emphasis placed on productivity and efficiency in public policy. (82)

> What Marx has built into his mode of analysis is a persuasive way to understand the fraught and problematic link between value (the socially necessary labor-time congealed in commodities) and the ways in which the monetary system represents that value. (83)

"From here on in, the argument becomes much easier." Hallelujah!

# Part 2

## Chapter 4: The General Formula for Capital

- Marx claims that the world trade/market date from 16th century, and after that modern history of capital starts to unfold.
- Exchange brings about money. How does money get transformed into capital, Marx asks?
	1. First we have a difference in the form of circulation: from [[C-M-C]] (transformation of commodities into money and then re-conversion of money into commodities i.e. selling in order to buy) to [[M-C-M]] (transformation of money into commodities, then re-conversion into money i.e. buying in order to sell). Money on the latter course is capital.
		- Marx asks us to examine the circular movement of  M-C-M a little more closely. It consists of two antithetical phases: M-C (purchase) and C-M (sale): ![[marxfowkes1981 Capital p246.pdf screenshot.jpg]]
	- It doesn't make sense to just put $100 in circulation and get back $100. One needs to get back more. So let's examine this path that we take with M-C-M and C-M-C.
		- "The simple 'circulation of commodities begins with a sale and ends with a ;ï¿½urchase, while the circulation of money as capital begins with a p ch.ase and ends :Vitï¿½ a salï¿½." ([[marxfowkes1981 Capital.pdf#page=247|249]])
			- Mediated in the first form by money, second form by commodity. Different end points.
		- In C-M-C the money is converted into a commodity which serves as a **use-value** â€” thus it's been spent once and for all.
		- In M-C-M buyer puts down money to get more money, speculatively. (Thus money is not spent, "it is merely advanced" (249)).
			- Simple circulation of commodities money is displaced twice â€”seller gets it from buyer, pays it to another seller (one hand to another). The money goes from one to another. But with capital the displacement of the same commoodity causes money to flow back to its initial point (same hands).
	- CMC can only be repeated â€” the cycle is not circular.
		- ![[202307041033 Preview - marxfowkes1981 Capital.pdf screenshot.jpg]]
	- Since M-C-M is not just tautological (i.e., it's not just symmetrical â€” exchanging $100 for $100), we need to modify the formula. Money - Money is strictly tautological in that it has same economic form, there are not qualtiatively different use-values (like there are with commodity exchange (i.e, how useful something is to me)). Money is only distinguishable in amount â€” money is commodities extinguished of use-value and converted. Therefore we have to think of it as M-C-M' (Money prime â€” more money is withdrawn than put in).
		- "This increment or excess over the original value I call '==**surplus-value**=='." This movement is what converts it into [[capital]]!
	- Importantly, while C-M-C may have quantitivaley different magnitudes of value (may sell corn above value or buy clothes on sale), these are accidental. Equivalence of poles here is necessary for normal functioning â€” opposite of M-C-M. 
	- Incredible language here describing endless repetition/renewal of buying in order to sell (whereas reverse is finite):
		- ![[202307041048 Preview - marxfowkes1981 Capital.pdf screenshot.jpg]]
- To summarize: circulating commodities is means to capture use-values. Circulation of money as capital is an end itself (valorization of value).
- [[marxfowkes1981 Capital.pdf#page=252|254]]: "As the conscious bearer [Trager] of this movement [M-C-M], the possessor of money becomes a capitalist"
	- but isn't this a role that many people, even workers play with pensions etc?
	- This is an icnredible page showing how capitalists are just after ever more money to line their pockets. It's the sole driving force behind his operations â€” the unceasing movement of profit-making.
