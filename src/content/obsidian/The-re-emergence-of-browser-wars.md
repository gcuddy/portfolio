# The re-emergence of browser wars

Seems there's several new startups focused on innovating on the browser. That's probably a good thing, because the Chromium/Firefox/Safari debate is very limited, with Chromium having an outsized market share (and sites like web.dev being marketing for Chrome), Safari/Webkit being their own thing, and Firefox still being cool — but is also owned by Google. Brave and Edge are also Chromium based.

Some new ones:

* [Orion Browser by Kagi](https://browser.kagi.com/)
  * A very fast Webkit based browser for Mac. I like it a lot, but again it's still Webkit-based, and comes with all of those (loving) flaws.
  * They claim it's the "fastest browser in existence"
  * Importantly, it supports Chrome and Firefox extensions.
  * As of [[2022-05-20]] i'm using it, and I like it... I think. But I'm a multi browser kind of guy.
  * Questionable pricing model? (There is none — but they're building a "premium" (uh oh) search engine called Kagi, so perhaps that's where the profit is)
* [The Browser Company](https://thebrowser.company) - the Browser Company of New York - [[Arc Browser]]
* [Mighty | A new browser to work faster](https://www.mightyapp.com) - Mighty is a new browser for work that loads pages faster, saves you time, and makes you more productive.
  * Have an invite but hilariously costs $30/month, which is an entirely unacceptable future for the web. Intrigued by the tech here, but I won't stand for the Superpower-fication of the Web Browser.

Original browser wars — Mosaic, Netscape

> A browser war is competition for dominance in the usage share of web browsers. The "First Browser War," during the late 1990s, pitted Microsoft's Internet Explorer against Netscape's Navigator. **browser wars** continued with the decline of Internet Explorer's market share and the popularity of other browsers including Firefox, Google Chrome (and other Chromium-based browsers), Safari, Microsoft Edge and Opera.
>
> With the introduction of HTML5 and CSS 3, a new generation of browser war began, this time adding extensive client-side scripting to the World Wide Web, as well as more widespread use of smartphones and other mobile devices for browsing the web. These newcomers have ensured that browser battles continue among enthusiasts, while the average web user is less affected.
