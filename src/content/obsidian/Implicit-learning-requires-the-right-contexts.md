originalFileName: Implicit learning requires the right contexts.md

[[Implicit learning]] is when we discover complex patterns in an incindental manner over time through *intuition*.

But as Robin Hogarth explores in *Educating Intuition*, we can't tell people to discover these patterns explicitly. We can only set up the right **contexts** for implicit learning.

Hogarth proposes that implicit learning needs to be set in a proper context with:

1. Clear information
2. Tightly coupled feedback
3. Error matters

John Vervaeka and colleagues have proposed that these contexts are also the conditions for [[Flow State]].

One can see how these three criteria could easily lead to [[games as flow state]]
