    - Best translation is the one by [Robert M. Adams](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393928837/). [Burton Raffel](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FBFO5U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000FBFO5U&linkCode=as2&tag=8648526-20&linkId=JXTMNIAXEBYZI4WL) translation is good too.

- Friedman, The Machinery of Freedom
- Laozi, Dao De Jing
- Mann, 1491
- Cowen, Discover Your Inner Economist

- Cowen, The Great Stagnation & Average is Over

- Balzac, Cousin Bette
- Ford, Lights in the Tunnel

- Doherty, Radicals for Capitalism
    - Details the rise of the American libertarian movement. Serious study, but the personalities are so crazy that it’s fun to read.

- Heilbroner, The Worldly Philosophers
    - The first economics-y book I read; I spent two years of undergrad wondering when we were going to cover Thorstein Veblen.
- Thaler & Sunstein, Nudge
    - Super well argued, I couldn’t continue to be a knee-jerk skeptic.
- St. Aubyn, Patrick Melrose series
- When I was little I read most of the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett. I really liked them, but haven’t picked any of them up again.

- George, Ninety Percent of Everything: Inside Shipping
    - I love ships and ships love me back. This is pretty much the perfect nonfiction book: many, many interesting facts weaved into a narrative story; and it’s slim, and doesn’t go overboard with too much detail.
- Benford, The Wonderful Future that Never Was ([related essay](https://danwang.co/technological-predictions-twentieth-century/))

    - The war from the perspective of the German population. One interesting fact: A quarter of Goebbel’s budget was spent on theatre, which was about as much as he spent on propaganda, and more than twice as much on film.
- Pomeranz and Topik, The World That Trade Created
- Chang, Factory Girls: From Village to City in a Changing China

- Stephenson, Snow Crash
- Arthur, The Nature of Technology: What it is and How it Evolves
- Ge Fei, The Invisibility Cloak

    - A history that reads almost like a novel
- Cartledge, A System Apart: Hong Kong’s Political Economy from 1997 Until Now
- Mann, Buddenbrooks
    - Much easier to get through than Der Zauberberg
    - A very Chinese novel… shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in four generations
- Lewis, The Tang Dynasty
    - What’s important about Tang? Drainage projects in the south (Jiangnan and Lingnan), making it the permanent economic center of the empire; institutionalization of the Sui Codes; breaking of the aristocratic families.
- Bernhard, The Loser
- Hanson, The Second World Wars
    - At some point one should decide to stop reading about this topic. This superb book is about it for me.
- Babitz, Slow Days, Fast Company: The World, The Flesh, and L.A.: Tales
- Shakespeare, King Lear
    - The heaps of suffering make it feel a little bit ridiculous by the end. Otherwise, it is very good.
- Stephenson, Some Remarks: Essays and Other Writing
    - Worth reading for the Stephenson fan. And which geek wouldn’t be?
- Johnstone, We Were Burning: Japanese Entrepreneurs And The Forging Of The Electronic Age
    - The book does not live up to its fantastic title. Heaps of facts, but not really conceptually-driven, and I did not find that I was able to drew many broader lessons.
- Kuhn, The Age of Confucian Rule: The Song Transformation of China
- Brook, The Troubled Empire: China in the Yuan and Ming Dynasties
    - The best in the HUP History of Imperial China series; most analytically-driven, a focus on the right topics, and most cleverly written. It’s helpful to learn the impact of the Little Ice Age on the Ming.
- Leys, The Hall of Uselessness: Collected Essays
    - Very good reflections on Chinese aesthetics, with a focus on painting and calligraphy
- Rowe, China’s Last Empire: The Great Qing
- Lee, Pachinko
- Cao, Dream of the Red Chamber
- Sigmund, Exact Thinking in Demented Times
    - An excellent book about some extraordinary people. It’s as demented as advertised.
- Ball, The Water Kingdom: A Secret History of China
    - I thought this was quite bad, so I’m encouraging you to skip it
- Mikitani and Mikitani, The Power to Compete
    - My favorite genre of book: A realization that economic growth has been way too slow, and constructive proposals to accelerate it
- Pierenkemper and Tilly, The German Economy During the Nineteenth Century
- Lewis, The Money Culture
- Field, A Great Leap Forward: 1930s Depression and U.S. Economic Growth

- Vogel, Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China
- Porter, Takeuchi, & Sakakibara, Can Japan Compete?
    - Evaluation of Japanese industrial policy

- Naipaul, An Area of Darkness
- Girard, I See Satan Fall Like Lightning
- Baldwin, The Great Convergence,
- Heilmann, The Red Swan
- Dyson, Disturbing the Universe
- Spence, The Search for Modern China
- Simmons, Hyperion
    - Absorbing story, but it also makes me see why science fiction has a bad name in so many circles
- Clark, Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600–1947
    - Ultimately a disappointment, with too much of a focus on political personalities. I am still desperate to read a good history of Germany, with a focus on economic growth rather than individual leaders.

    - Michael Kater watched a lot of movies and read many contemporary books to tell us about the cultural policies and outputs of the Third Reich
- PKD, A Scanner Darkly
- St Aubyn, Dunford
    - It’s fun to read St Aubyn’s accounts of how really rich people can be really mean to each other, but it’s fine to stop with the Patrick Melrose series, which are hard to surpass, and which indeed Dunford fails to surpass
- Perez, Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital
- Thackray et al., Moore’s Law
    - A biography of Gordon Moore, much of it skippable, but there’s a good history of the development of Shockley, Fairchild, Intel, and thus Silicon Valley
- Stapledon, Last and First Men & Star Maker
    - A Hegelian presents two astonishing science fiction novels written in the ’30s. The plot is breathtaking, this is one of my favorite science fiction books.

    - There are some interesting facts, but this is not a very conceptual presentation of history
