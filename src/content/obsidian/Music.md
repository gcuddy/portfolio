[[ᐤ△ Music 2022 - Get back into locally owning my music library, audiophilia]]

* For organizing: https://macwright.com/2020/01/27/my-music-library.html
  * Now he uses Roon, though. But I still can't understand what roon is...

Areas I want to explore more: Indian Classical, Clasiscal

This is recommended by tspdt: http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/
and of course the work of [[Ted Gioia]] and his website: tedgioia.com

* also he has great lists for [[Reading]] as well...

* https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/08/musical-self-education.html

* https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/09/is-this-the-very-best-book-ever-written.html
  * Heart of Rock and Soul https://www.amazon.com/Heart-Rock-Soul-Dave-Marsh/dp/0452263050/ref=sr\_1\_1?keywords=dave+marsh+heart+of+rock+and+soul\&qid=1567545182\&s=gateway\&sr=8-1/marginalrevol-20
    * "It is possible *it has become the greatest book of all time because of YouTube*.  Scroll through the pithy, one-page or sometimes even one-paragraph reviews of the various songs, and play them on YouTube while you are reading."
      * Of course I’m not trying to sell you on music or for that matter on Dave Marsh.  What about reading Abraham Pais, [Niels Bohr’s Times: In Physics, Philosophy, and Polity](https://www.amazon.com/Niels-Bohrs-Physics-Philosophy-Polity/dp/0198520492/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=abraham+pais\&qid=1567544913\&s=gateway\&sr=8-2/marginalrevol-20), accompanied by [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=niels+bohr+atom)?  Might the possibility of YouTube combination make that the 37th best book of all time, displacing Braudel or Flaubert?
        * Should not at least 2/3 of your reading be books accompanied by YouTube?  And if not, why not?
          * This actually is about [[read]] and [[self-education]]
