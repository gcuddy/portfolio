This idea comes from Ton Zylstra:

> I've found that in my notes those that feel 'best' are about 200 words (I dubbed it NMI, note mass index at the time). If there's more usually there's something that can be split off. 500 words is about a single A4 page, 200 under half one. Compared to index cards both 200 and 500 words still seem large for an atomic note though. Vgl [[200 woorden als NMI 20201209120355]]

> wrt that Steven Johnson reference <https://web.archive.org/web/20120204062049/http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/movabletype/archives/000230.html> talks about "Most of the entries are in a sweet spot where length is concerned: between 50 and 500 words", and then says we may be overlooking that fact because 500 words is about the unit of all web articles, and way more focused info than e.g. a book. Mentions 'chunks' as a term for such a snippet, reminds me of chunking when it comes to remembering. Later in that posts mentions making 200 to 1000 extracts from books hypothetically for an automated process. So there's a bunch of ranges there 50-1000. That blogpost does give me some ideas to use DevonThink better as an exploration tool of my notes.

Essentially that a "zettel" or "atomic note" or notion or whatever should be around 200-500 words — that's about a half page to a page of A4.

I like this number because it feels fairly attainable! 200 words is not very many words at all.

This also reminds me of other "magic numbers", such as the rule of threes (or is it fours?), Dunbar's Number, and [this idea](https://twitter.com/zsviczian/status/1535981412108623873) that the ideal folder size is around 21 items — after that, you should split it into sub folders.
