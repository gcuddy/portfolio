\*\*\*\*## unicode needed

* checklist?
*

## current

Open Project: ᐤ△
Area: ᐤ⨳
Completed Project: ᐤ▲

The ᐤ is so that you can search that to get all projects/areas.

## thinking

Ryan murphy has the best use of unicode characrters I've seen. By putting them in title they act like inline "tags".

This is a fantastic website for learning about characters: https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/'

[[ryanjamurphy]] mentions some of what he does here: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/a-workbench-note/6731 which eventually turned into his Workbench Plugin

## Current

Current set (inspired by [[ryanjamurphy]])

* ᐤ := open
* • := closed
* ∵ := responsibility
* ᠅ := role
* △ := project
* ⟁ := subject
* ⧉ := inbox
* ☰ := wayfinder
* ∎ := summary (looks like this one doesn't show up)
* ꆜ := Person
* ↯ question
* ⫝ Bookmark (can use to bookmark block or note)

↯ Ones I'm looking at potentially adding:

☰ - Kanban?
⧠ - Data?

* Place?
* Research Note
* List?
* Data Point... for Tracker stuff lie Habits?

ones ryan seems to have:
output?
☵ Wayfinding? ⫝

Another one I like: idea

Maybe it's list? Or general note?

Then there's his Unicode for coding ideas

Not sure! It's ☵

## Unicode I like

⦚ ⧠
﹋ ﹌
𐂂
𐁅
𐁖
𐀊

I went down the rabbit hole and grabbed some favorites.
Here are the associated codes:
`&#9781; &#10803; &#10697; &#10857; &#10399; &#8278; &#10669; — &#8944; &#8704; &#10209; &#8894; &#8895; — &#8258; &#8266; &#8281; &#8280; &#926; &#8694; &#10227; — &#10475; &#10459; &#10485; &#127074; &#10487; &#10495;`

#⫝ Here's the set of symbols I was playing with. I'm not as diligent as Nick so I don't have the codes, but you can copy and paste these:

```
## From math:
⊗ := the tensor product, a generalization of nonlinear vector space. See https://www.math3ma.com/blog/the-tensor-product-demystified
▲ := delta, change
⋈ := bowtie, natural join of two relations
× := multiplication; cross product
∧ := logical and
∨ := logical or
∪ := Union
∩ := Intersection
∑ := summation
↯ := contradiction
≀ := wreath product
⨳ := smash product

## Others:
Candidate symbols: ↓ for wayfinding points on a map. ∎ denotes the end of a proof, aligns with the "finished" nature of these notes. ∴ is used at the end of articles to indicate the reader has reached the end. The forking symbol ⫝ looks like an anchor.
## Misc:
⟐⟠⧉❖◇◆⟁∵☉⚛︎⚔︎⚒︎☍☌⚓︎⎊

## Tasks/todos:

⊗

𖤘\
𖡺\
𖤂\
𖦏 - quick? next?
𖠱

#note/refactor

## Bamum

Bamum Supplement has quite a few amazing characters:

https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/block/U+16800

* 𖡗
* 𖠵 quick
* ≀ low energy

§ synthesis (this is from andy and i still like it)

𖦐 - movie (?) ((like a reel))
𖥁
⨡

## Project System

* open/someday ◌
* backburner/todo ○ (kills me that these aren't the same size)
* Active/In Progress - ◑
* Enagements - ⨀
* Completed ✓ (there's no circled checkmark for god sake)
* Canceled - ⊗
