An ai generative art thingy 

https://www.midjourney.com/home/

> **midjourney** is an independent research lab that produces a proprietary artificial intelligence program that creates images from textual descriptions similar to Stable Diffusion that is open-source and OpenAI's DALL-E. The tool is currently in open beta, which it entered on July 12, 2022. The Midjourney team is led by David Holz, who co-founded Leap Motion. Midjourney uses a freemium business model, with a limited free tier and paid tiers that offer faster access, greater capacity, and additional features. Holz told The Register in August 2022 that the company was already profitable. Users create artwork with Midjourney using Discord bot commands.
