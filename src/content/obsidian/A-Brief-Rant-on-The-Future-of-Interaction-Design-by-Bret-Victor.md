## highlights

P==ictures Under Glass is an interaction paradigm of permanent numbness==. It's a Novocaine drip to the wrist. It denies our hands what they do best. And yet, it's the star player in every Vision Of The Future.

To me, claiming that Pictures Under Glass is the future of interaction is like claiming that black-and-white is the future of photography. It's _obviously_ a transitional technology. And the sooner we transition, the better.

What can you do with a Picture Under Glass? You can slide it.

That's the fundamental gesture in this technology. Sliding a finger along a flat surface.

There is _almost nothing in the natural world_ that we manipulate in this way.

Despite how it appears to the culture at large, technology doesn't just _happen_. It doesn't emerge spontaneously, pulling us helplessly toward some inevitable destiny. Revolutionary technology comes out of long research, and research is performed and funded by inspired people.
