# When it comes to software, speed is king.

If [[Technology acts as an extension of our body and brain]], then it only makes sense that we want it to work at the *speed* of our  body and brains.  Which is to say: near-instantaneously.

Small differences add up. I want my software to work quickly. Slow software kills the creative process and getting into [[Flow State]].

For instance, the very compelling software [[Roam Research]] is great in so many ways: it offers a paradigm-shifting approach to note-taking, its smartly executed, it has an exciting feature-set. But at the same time: it's too slow. If I'm really going to use Roam as my [[Second Brain]], then I'm going to need it to move *quick*. In Roam, every time I type CMD-U to bring up the Search/Create a Page window, it takes at least 2 seconds for my typing to catch up to Roam. I sit there in agony and wait. And if I misspelled something, I have to then wait to delete it, spell it correctly, and try the whole thing over again. No fun.
