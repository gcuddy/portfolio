A series of videos by [[John Vervaeke]] on meaning in contemporary society. Takes a lot from philosophy, cognitive science, and buddhism.

## Episode 1 - Introduction

- Overlap between cognitive science and buddhism.
- We're in the midst of a "mindfulness revolution".
- "Wisdom" is a very hot topic right now. Books that try to "train" you in wisdom are popular (i.e. Stoicism books)
- Increase in popularity in psychedelics
	- Solution rate for therapy goes from 20% to 80% with pschyedelics [Source?]
- "Meaning" in life is very important: very predictive of how you're doing in life. People are seeking it out
- It's no coinicdence that all these things are happening right now
- Mental health crisis: suicide is striking
	- Some socioeconomic factors here, but there are other factors at work
	- People are losing touch with reality
	- Nihilism, cynicism, frustration/utility
	- abandonment of trust in systems: government, judicial, religious participation declining
- More and more "BULLSHIT" everywhere (book: On Bullshit). 
- Shows up in mythologies
	- Zombies, superheroes
	- We're stuck somehow. People are always talking about collapse, crisis, apocalypse

Key questions:
1. What is meaning?
2. Why do we hunger for it?
3. And how do we cultivate wisdom to realize it?

- Why do we need to alter consciousness? (Animals do this as well)

deep connections between meaning, wisdom, self transcendence and altered state of consciousness

" Ignorance is a lack of knowledge. Foolishness is a lack of wisdom."

### How and why is this meaning such a part of our humanity?

- We have to start somewhere - but that's not meant to indicdate an absolute starting point. Goes back probably before humanity
- So let's start as a place where we can recognize humanity as "us".

#### Upper Paleolithic transition (~ 40,000 BCE)

- we've existed long before this (200,000 bce). but there's a change here, a continuum but a radical change

Q: What are isome of the big changes in the Upper Paleolithic transition (~40,000 BCE)?
A: Making representational art, making music, significant increase in cognition
<!--ID: 1616691654951-->



- They're making **representational art**. Good evidence they're making **music**
- **Significant evidence in their cognition**
	- First use of calendars (moon phases, passage of days)
	- Keeping track of time across abstract patterns to enhance hunting abilities
	- Developing **projectile weapons**
		- Neandtherals don't have projectile weapons. They get in close (they have bone damage akin to cowboy rodeos)
		- Bone tips for projectile weapons. We have spear thrower and sling - now we're carrying missles and **project** them at logn distance
		- This requires increase in dev of frontal lobe
		- Concept of throwing is DEEP in cognition: **project** - you're throwing. **object** - thrown against. **subject** - thrown under.

Around 30,000 BCE went through near extinction. Down to max of 10,000 individuals - we almost died off!

Humanity faced a {near-extinction event} in {30,000 BCE}, down to a max of {10,000 individuals}?
<!--ID: 1616691654992-->


Q: What was humanity's response to the environmental challenge of their near extinction event in 30,000 BCE?
A: Developing ritual for enhanced trust with others.
<!--ID: 1616691654957-->



Interesting response to this extinction event:
- Not a technological response, but a socio-cognitive response
	- create broader trading networks -> more resources and discoveries. opens scale of human cognition.
	- developed **ritual** for dealing with enviornmental challenge
		- **We live in cities** but take this for granted. **human beings live with strangers** - and we accept that that's OK! Other animals don't do this.
		- these rituals enhance our abilities to come into trust with others for individuals we don't really know (ie Handshakes)
		- move from first person to third person perspective

**Exaptation** - originally from biology. Evolutionary mechanism.
E.g. evolution took the tongue which evolved for food/detecting poison, and exapted it for speech

brain develops mechanism for doing one thing, and then learns to reuse forr osomethign different

"In shamanism what you have is you have a cultivated practice for altering your state of consciousness that taps into and exapts this enhanced “mind sight”, this enhanced ability to manipulate and control your mental state and your emotional state."

Michael Wineklman: pervasive through hunter-gatherer groups are **shamanic individuals**.
Such a pervasive historical figure that it's almost become an **archetypal figure** (wise old man)- Yoga, Merlin
If you have a Shaman it's best health care, reduce discord, enhance hunting

**Why are shamans so effective?**
Plausible case can be made that the advent of shamanism helps explain how human beings are capable of this sudden explosion in their cognition

Upper Paleolithic transition not hardware change, but software change in brain. Shamanism plays a huge part.

**Psychotechnology**
Technology means systematic use of a tool
Your brain has evolved to use tools - when you start using a tool your brain will start to model it as part of the body (ie when in car parking your body is the car). You're a "natural born cyborg" (Andy Clark)
Beyond nakedness, everything else is tools: clothes, watch, shoes, walls, chairs, **everything is tools**

This can be **exapted**
Brain's abilility to attach to a tool can move from physical thing onto a cognitive thing
Physical tools fit your biology and ehnahce it - ie a water bottle

Psychotechnology fits brain and enhances it.
Example: **LITERACY** - you're not born literate (you're born linguistic).
Literacy is a "standard set of tools that standardize how you process information"
Without literacy: can't imagine words, can't write things down, can't reflect on cognition.
**Psychotechnology enhance software** of machinery... like a major firmawre update?

**Shamnism is a set of psychotechnologies for altering state of consciousness and enhancing cognition**

Shamn is trying to disrupt normal ways inw hich you're finding pattersn in the world

Nine-Dot Problem, join with four straight lines. To do it you have to literally 'think outside the box'. You were projecting a pattern: 'the square'
Giving people the belief that they need to 'think ouside the box' does not help them with this problem
You shouldn't reduce all of your sense of knowing to believing.
You have to **know** how to go outside the box

Participatory insight: Shaman enacts the animal, not to get beliefs of der. But to become the deer. Enhances ability to track and find deer.

## Episode 2 - Flow, Metaphor, and the Axial Revolution
- [[Flow State]]
- [[Shamanism]]

- Refers to Robin Hogarth - Educating Intuition

Q: How does John Vervaeke define intuition?
A: As the ability to detect patterns, but not knowing how.
<!--ID: 1616689601578-->


Q: Give an example of intuition's ability to unconsciously detect patterns.
A: Knowing societal norms, like how far away to stand from people
<!--ID: 1616689601586-->


Q: What is it called when we learn complex information in an incidental manner?
A: Implicit learning
<!--ID: 1616689601591-->


{Cognitive biases} are when {implicit learning} goes bad: mistaking {correlation} for {casuation}.
<!--ID: 1616689601600-->


Q: Give an example of mistaking correlation and causation.
A: greenhouse gases going up, pirates going down
<!--ID: 1616689601596-->


[[Implicit learning requires the right contexts]]

- Robin Hogarth – Educating Intuition
	- You can't tell people to discover patterns explicitly
		- We can set up the right **contexts** for implicit learning
		- **"Science is distinguishing causation patterns from correlation patterns"**
			- Hogarth: implicit learning should be in proper context
				- Clear information
				- Tightly coupled feedback
				- Error matters
			- Vervaeke and colleagues: these contexts are also conditions for flow state
- Shaman is getting in deeply immersive flow state
	- Getting in insight cascade
		- Insight - exploring for new patterns
	- Enhanced implicit learning
		- Implicit learning - picking up those new patterns
	- Both insight cascade and implicit learning reinforce each other
	- Someone who is expert in getting into flow state is someone you want to keep and be around
	- Shaman is *making meaning*
		- Rossano, Wienkel have done research here
		- Connecting parts of brain that don't normally talk to each other
			- Making metaphors, making meaning

Q: What is a metaphor doing to your brain?
A: Connecting parts of the brain that don't normally talk to each other.
<!--ID: 1616691654964-->


- Brain is learning to get areas to talk to each other that nirmally don't talk to each other
	- Brani scan of psychedelic experience, etc shows this
- Capacity of metaphor:
	- Connect things that normally aren't connected
	- So much is metaphor
		- "metaphor", "reflect", "see my point", "comprehend/grasp this"
	- Lakoff and Johnson: Metaphors We Live By
	- {Metaphors} is how we make, for starters, {creative connections} and {new ideas}
	- {Flow state} is a generator of {metaphors}
	-  Origin of Getting high = oversight, supervision
<!--ID: 1616691654998-->




- Agricultural revolution
	- People start to stay in one place

- Bronze Age
	- Usually haven't read things from here, versus Metal
	- Gilgamesh, Egypt, etc


- Metal Age, Axial Age
	- Why does Bronze Age collapse?
		- We don't know for sure
		- Greatest collapse world has ever known
			- Closest thing to collapse: loss of culture, literacy
			- Literacy was cuneiform, hieroglyphics
				- Your entire job was to be litearte (scribe)
	- 800 BCE - 300 BCE
		- Here we invented new psychotechnology: alphabetical literacy
			- MUCH more learner, much more efficient
			- Can store thought independent of memory
				- "Second Order Thinking"
					- When you internalize psychotechnology into metacognition, improves your ability to critically analyze your own thinking
				- "Metacognition"

		- Coinage is invented
			- Abstract symbols
			- Numeracy
		- Start to realize more personal sense of responsibility
			- Axial Age: people stasrt to realize that chaos/war is not the way of the world
			- "Dhammapada"
	- Something happened here that was formative of us

Q: What important new psycho-technology was invented during the Axial Age (800-300 BCE)?
A: Alphabetical literacy
<!--ID: 1616691654970-->


Q: Why was alphabetical literacy different then Bronze Age literacy?
A: Bronze age literacy relied people whose entire job was to be literate (scribes).
<!--ID: 1616691654977-->


Q: What were some cognitive implications of alphabetical literacy?
A: Ability to store thought indepdent of memory, second order thinking, metacognition
<!--ID: 1616691654981-->


Q: What is metacognition?
A: The understanding of your own thought processes
<!--ID: 1616691654988-->
