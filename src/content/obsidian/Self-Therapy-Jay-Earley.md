## Highlights

- improved the effectiveness of my work with clients. IFS was so good that I switched over to practicing it almost exclusively, and it has enabled my clients ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=125))
- appreciation for how profound it is. Recently I was impressed with how it helps my clients approach ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=128))
- However, if we treat them like little beings inside of us who have our best interests at heart, we become open to a brand new way of relating to our feelings. We can get to know them, understand what drives them, and actually befriend them. When this happens, these parts will change, so they don’t have to overeat or flip out in rage anymore. They can relax and act sensibly. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=195))
- The human mind isn’t a unitary thing that sometimes has irrational feelings. It is a complex system of interacting parts, each with a mind of its own. It’s like an internal family--with wounded children, impulsive teenagers, rigid adults, hypercritical parents, caring friends, nurturing relatives, and so on. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=206))
- Underlying this cast of characters, every human being has a true Self that is wise, deep, open, and loving. This is who we truly are when we aren’t being hijacked by painful or defensive voices. The Self is the key to healing and integrating our disparate parts through its compassion, curiosity, and connectedness. It is also the natural leader of our inner family, a guide through the adventures of life. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=290))
- Because over the years we have experienced hurts, trauma, and grief, which have burdened us with shame, fear, and negative beliefs. These events have prompted some of our inner characters to take over in a desperate bid to protect us from harm. They blot out our pain, and, in the process, the light of the Self gets dimmed or lost. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=294))
- Experience with IFS shows that every part has a positive intent for you. It may want to protect you from harm or help you feel good about yourself. It may want to keep you from feeling pain or make other people like you. Every part of you is trying to help you feel good and avoid pain. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=306))
- You can’t get rid of a part of your psyche. You can only push it into the unconscious, where it will continue to affect you without your awareness. In IFS, we do something altogether different and radical. We welcome all our parts with curiosity and compassion. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=334))
- Chapter 2 Your Internal System Summary of the IFS Model This chapter introduces you to the IFS model, developed by psychologist Richard Schwartz, and gives a quick overview of how it works. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=440))
- Parts are entities of their own, with their own feelings, beliefs, motivations, and memories. It is especially important to understand that parts have motivations for everything they do. Nothing is just done out of habit. Nothing is just a pattern of thinking or behavior you learned. Everything (except for purely physiological reactions) is done by a part for a reason, even though that reason may be unconscious. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=450))
- Understanding the psyche in this way gives you a great deal of power to change your inner world for the better. Since parts are like little people inside you, you can make contact with them, get to know them, negotiate with them, encourage them to trust you, help them communicate with each other, and give them what they need to heal. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=454))
- Many parts perform roles that are healthy and functional. They make sure your life works well. They may help you connect with people or get work done. They may help you assert yourself or comprehend the world. Many parts have positive qualities that enhance your inner experience and external life, and allow you to cope with difficulties that come your way. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=476))
- Other parts, however, have taken on more extreme roles in a desperate attempt to protect you from pain, vulnerability, or harm. In IFS, an extreme role amounts to any action, feeling or thought that is dysfunctional. Quite simply, a part playing an extreme role causes problems in your life; it hampers it at best and cripples it at worst. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=479))
- There are two kinds of extreme parts—protectors and exiles. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=491))
- The job of protectors[1] is to protect you from feeling pain. They try to arrange your life and your psyche so that you are always in a kind of comfort zone and you never feel hurt, shame, or fear. They attempt to protect you from hurtful incidents or distressing relationships in your current life that could bring up buried pain from childhood. Since this can be intense, protectors are keen on preventing it from being activated. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=492))
- Protectors don’t realize that you aren’t a child anymore. They don’t realize that you have many more strengths and resources now, and you usually aren’t in danger as you were in the past. They try to avoid any situation that is similar to what you experienced as a child. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=500))
- In standard psychological language, these protectors are called “defenses.” ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=505))
- Exercise: Learning about Protectors Think about two of your protectors. For each one, write out answers to the following questions: What is its role in helping you manage your life and interact with the world? How does it relate to other people? How does it protect you from pain? What is its positive intent for you? What is it trying to protect you from? ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=531))
- Exiles are young child parts that are in pain from the past. While protectors try to keep us from feeling pain, exiles are the parts in pain. They are the ones the protectors are trying to protect us from. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=538))
- Exiles are often stuck at a particular time in childhood, at a specific age. They are literally two years old, or five or seven, and they exist in a situation from that time in your life. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=540))
- If your family life was chaotic, you will probably have an exile that feels jumbled inside. If your family treated each other with cold silence most of the time, you may have an ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=553))
- In addition to painful emotions, exiles have negative beliefs about you and about the world. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=561))
- Because exiles hold pain from your past, they are pushed away by protectors. They are exiled from your inner life and kept in dark dungeons away from the light of consciousness. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=565))
- An exile is usually caught in its own little world and is unaware that you have grown up and developed the capacity to take care of yourself, make friends, be independent, and perhaps start your own family. All it is aware of is a certain painful situation from your early life. Whenever something happens in the present that is similar, it reactivates that pain, which comes bubbling up toward the surface. Then your protectors go into high gear to prevent you from having to feel ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=566))
- Exercise: Learning about Exiles Think about two of your exiles. For each one, please write out the answers to the following questions: What emotions does it feel? What pain does it carry? What is it afraid of? What negative beliefs does it have? What situation or relationship is it stuck in from childhood? What current situations tend to trigger it? What protectors come up when that happens? ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=593))
- We all have a core part of us that is our true self, our spiritual center. When our extreme parts are not activated and in the way, this is who we are. The Self is relaxed, open, and accepting of yourself and others. When you are in Self, you are grounded, centered, and non-reactive. You don’t get triggered by what people do. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=611))
- Let’s look at four qualities of the Self that are particularly important for psychological healing. When you are in Self, you will naturally embody these qualities. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=628))
- The Self is connected. When you are in Self, you naturally feel close to other people and want to relate in harmonious, supportive ways. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=629))
- The Self also wants to be connected to your parts. When you are in Self, you are interested in having a relationship with each of your parts, which helps them to trust you, opening the way for healing. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=631))
- The Self is curious. When you are in Self, you are curious about other people in an open, accepting way. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=632))
- The Self is compassionate. Compassion is a form of kindness and love that arises when people are in pain. You genuinely care about how they feel and want to support them through difficult times. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=637))
- The Self is calm, centered, and grounded. This is especially helpful when you are relating to a part that has intense emotions. Intense grief or shame, for example, can be overwhelming if you aren’t grounded in Self, and protectors will avoid a part that has emotions like this at all costs. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=642))
- There are two goals for IFS therapy: one, heal your parts so that their extreme roles are converted to healthy roles, and two, help them to cooperate with each other under the leadership of the Self. ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=666))
- Parts aren’t defined by the negative beliefs and emotions they took on in childhood, which IFS calls their burdens. They have their own potential that is intrinsic to them. That is why they can let go of a burden and take on a new role in the psyche. ([Location 940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=940))
- IFS has discovered that it is helpful to release a burden to one of the basic elements in nature—earth, fire, wind, water, or light. This signifies that the burden won’t come back because it has been carried away, or transformed, by something elemental and powerful. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=949))
- The IFS process is actually quite efficient and penetrating, but, paradoxically, it does this by being careful and respectful of protectors, not through strong-arm tactics. Furthermore, protectors are important in themselves. Since exiles are pushed into the background, it is the protectors that are out front relating to people and acting in the world. It isn’t enough to heal our exiles; our protectors must also be healed and transformed so they can drop their defensive roles, let their positive qualities emerge, and assume healthy roles in the inner system. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=997))
- The steps for getting to know a protector can be summarized as follows: In beginning a session, you access a number of protectors and then choose one to focus on, called the target part. You inhabit Self and get to know this protector, finding out its positive intent for you. You establish a trusting relationship with the protector and understand what it is trying to protect you from. This sets the stage for further work with the protector or for healing the exile it is protecting. ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1004))
  - mw:: Feels similar to focusing
- P5. “P” stands for protector. These steps constitute the content of Part I. P1: Accessing a part P2: Unblending from the target part P3: Unblending from a concerned part P4: Discovering a protector’s role P5: Developing a trusting relationship with a protector ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1008))
- Let’s suppose you have an issue you would like to work on. How do you know what parts to explore? In this section, we will show you how to determine which parts are involved with an issue. In IFS, issues are sometimes referred to as trailheads. A trailhead is an experience or a difficulty in your life that will lead to interesting parts if you follow it. It can be a situation or person that you react to, an emotional or bodily experience, a pattern of behavior or thinking, a dream, or anything else that indicates parts to explore. We call it a trailhead because it is the beginning of a trail that can lead to healing. It usually involves both a life situation and your response to that situation. ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1026))
- When you are at a trailhead, there is at least one part activated and often more than one. For example, when I am in a large group of strangers, I have at least three parts activated—one that is scared of being hurt, another part that wants to withdraw to protect me, and a third part that wants to reach out and talk to people despite the fear. ([Location 1046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1046))
  - mw:: identify with this
- You are likely to have at least one emotional reaction to the trailhead situation, perhaps more than one. You may feel angry, sad, or afraid, for example. In addition, you may notice certain attitudes you have in that situation; you may feel judgmental, thoughtless, stingy, careful, zany, doubtful, or mischievous. Each feeling, emotion, or attitude indicates the presence of a part, except for those attitudes that come from the Self, such as being kind or centered. Furthermore, if you feel cut off from your feelings, that is probably caused by a part. For example, if you feel dead, closed, or cold in a trailhead situation, there probably is a part causing this. ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1053))
- Most body sensations that come up in response to a trailhead are related to parts. The exceptions are purely physiological sensations (like a stomachache because of something you ate) and the bodily experiences of Self, such as feeling peaceful, open, or energetic. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1058))
- Many thoughts that arise in response to a trailhead situation come from parts. ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1063))
- An action or pattern of behavior can indicate a part—for example, withdrawing or becoming pushy. The avoidance of behavior also indicates a part. ([Location 1068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1068))
- Certain types of desires come from a part. One part may want closeness or success. Another might want to be seen and appreciated. A third might want to be left alone. ([Location 1070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1070))
- Let’s look at a more detailed example of a trailhead. When Betty visited her grown son’s house, she felt that he was being verbally abusive to his son, and she was considering talking to him about this but kept hesitating. ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1072))
  - mw:: six different parts based on emotions/desires/xensations
- Choose a trailhead that you are interested in exploring. Using the approach described above, make a list of each of the parts involved with that trailhead. For each part, write the following if you can: Name of part What it feels emotionally What it looks like What it feels like in your body and where What it says How it makes you behave What it wants ([Location 1091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1091))
- Step P1: Accessing a Part ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1101))
- Go inside and make contact with it experientially, through your emotions, images, body sensations, and internal voices. There are a variety of internal channels for accessing a part: ([Location 1107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1107))
- Feelings. ([Location 1108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1108))
- Body Sensations. ([Location 1109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1109))
- Images. ([Location 1110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1110))
- Internal Voice. ([Location 1114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1114))
- Written Dialogue. ([Location 1116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1116))
- Speaking as the Part.. ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1117))
- Direct Knowing. ([Location 1118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1118))
- However, it isn’t necessary to use many channels to access a part; just one is enough. ([Location 1132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1132))
- activated because of a situation you are in or are thinking about. Each activated part influences your feelings, your body, your thoughts, and your behavior. The rest of your parts are dormant but can be activated at any moment. ([Location 1139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1139))
- Parts become activated according to external situations or internal memories or thoughts. If you are relating to a person or dealing with an event that seems dangerous to one of your parts, it will activate and take over your psyche to protect you. ([Location 1144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1144))
- When you decide to access a part, it may already be activated at that moment, or it may be dormant. Access is done a little differently in each case. ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1150))
- Access is like shining the flashlight of consciousness on that part. ([Location 1152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1152))
- However, even if a part is not activated, you can still access it and work with it. You just need to activate the part first. A good way to do this is to remember a recent time when it was activated and imagine that you are in that situation now. ([Location 1154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1154))
- G: Male, huge, totally black, strong. ([Location 1198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1198))
  - mw:: jfc with this racist bullshit
- At any given moment, a trailhead may or may not be activated, just like a part. If it is activated, you will feel your reaction to it. When you want to explore a trailhead that isn’t activated at the moment, imagine a recent time when that trailhead was active and notice how you feel inside. Or notice how you usually feel when that trailhead is activated. Then you can access all the parts related to it. ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1235))
- For each part, write down what you experience: Name of part What it feels emotionally What it looks like What it feels like in your body and where What it says ([Location 1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1260))
- At the beginning of an IFS session, you may want to discuss an issue in your life or talk about some parts you are aware of. Pretty soon, however, this purely intellectual understanding ceases to be of much value. It is time to go inside and explore yourself experientially. Your goal will be to focus on one part to get to know in some depth (as you will learn how to do over the rest of the book). This is called the target part. You have three options for going about this: Start with a part you already know about and access it. Access all the parts activated at the current moment and then choose one to focus on. Start with a trailhead. Analyze it to see what parts are related to it and then choose one to access. Or access all the parts related to the trailhead experientially and then choose one. Once you start working with a part, others may get activated that you must deal with. Sometimes you will continue to work with the original target part, and sometimes you will change your focus to one of them. ([Location 1265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1265))
- At any point in the day when you notice that a part is activated, you can briefly access it and pay attention to how it is affecting you. This gives you information about how often it is triggered, under what circumstances, and how it affects your emotions, your behavior, and your life. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1282))
- At the end of each day, take a few minutes to review the day for moments when the part was activated. Add to your notes at this time. This daily review will also help you to keep this exercise in mind the next day. Notes to take each time it happens: Situation How you experience the part What about this situation triggered the part ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1298))
- We can explain this in another way using the concept of the seat of consciousness. We each have a place in our psyche that determines our identity, choices, feelings, and perceptions. This seat can be occupied by Self or by a part. Whoever resides in the seat of consciousness at any given moment is in charge of our psyche at that time. Whether it is a part or the Self, the occupant of the seat determines how we feel, what our intentions are, how we perceive other people, how we relate to them, and what our choices and actions will be. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1322))
  - mw:: this is an interesting mental model, and sure it does counter somewhat with buddhism - but on another level it can be considered in alignment with buddhism, especially with burbea’s idea of “ways of seeing”
    more i think about it the more it seems correct in some fundamental way. the Self is different than no-self in buddhism, but in another way it’s a capitalized Self and makes sense, and is omnipresent - a deeper consciousness, we’re not trying to eradicate selfhood, are we? just ego and trappings of considering solid self - but actually considering this fluid and being able to step back to a Self - very beautiful
- The Self is the natural occupant of the seat of consciousness because it is who we truly are. It is our essential nature, our spiritual center. This means that the Self occupies the seat of consciousness unless a part (such as Sheila’s Temper Tantrum Part) takes over the seat and pushes the Self into the background. Then that part is in charge of your psyche for a while. This can happen in an instant and usually without our realizing it. ([Location 1338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1338))
  - mw:: analogous to papanca?
- This example shows the two most common ways we relate to our difficult parts—either we are blended with them or we judge them. However, neither attitude is helpful in getting to know a part and connecting with it. To do that successfully, you must be centered in Self so you can relate to the part with curiosity and compassion. ([Location 1361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1361))
- attitudes and how to return to Self. This chapter ([Location 1364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1364))
- IFS distinguishes between two types of protectors—proactive managers and reactive firefighters—but there isn’t space to go into that distinction in this book. ([Location 5406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=5406))

## Highlights

- However, if we **treat them like little beings inside of us who have our best interests at heart**, we become open to a brand new way of **relating to our feelings**. We can get to know them, understand what drives them, and actually **befriend** them. When this happens, these parts will change, so they don’t have to overeat or flip out in rage anymore. They can relax and act sensibly. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=195))
- The human mind isn’t a unitary thing that sometimes has irrational feelings. It is a **complex system of interacting parts**, each with a mind of its own. It’s like an **internal family--with wounded children, impulsive teenagers, rigid adults, hypercritical parents, caring friends, nurturing relatives**, and so on. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=206))
- Underlying this **cast of characters**, every human being has a **true Self that is wise, deep, open, and loving**. This is who we truly are when we aren’t being hijacked by painful or defensive voices. **The Self is the key to healing and integrating** our disparate parts through its compassion, curiosity, and connectedness. It is also the natural leader of our inner family, a guide through the adventures of life. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=290))
- Because over the years we have experienced hurts, **trauma**, and grief, which have burdened us with shame, fear, and negative beliefs. These events have **prompted some of our inner characters to take over in a desperate bid to protect us from harm**. They blot out our pain, and, in the process, the light of the Self gets dimmed or lost. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=294))
- Experience with IFS shows that **every part has a positive intent for you**. It may want to protect you from harm or help you feel good about yourself. It may want to keep you from feeling pain or make other people like you. Every part of you is trying to help you feel good and avoid pain. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=306))
- **You can’t get rid of a part of your psyche. You can only push it into the unconscious**, where it will continue to affect you without your awareness. In IFS, we do something altogether different and radical. We **welcome all our parts with curiosity and compassion**. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=334))
- **Parts are entities of their own, with their own feelings, beliefs, motivations, and memories**. It is especially important to understand that **parts have motivations for everything they do**. Nothing is just done out of habit. Nothing is just a pattern of thinking or behavior you learned. Everything (except for purely physiological reactions) is done by a part for a reason, even though that reason may be unconscious. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=450))
- Understanding the psyche in this way gives you a great deal of power to change your inner world for the better. **Since parts are like little people inside you, you can make contact with them, get to know them, negotiate with them, encourage them to trust you, help them communicate with each other, and give them what they need to heal**. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=454))
- **Many parts perform roles that are healthy and functional**. They make sure your life works well. They may help you connect with people or get work done. They may help you assert yourself or comprehend the world. Many parts have positive qualities that enhance your inner experience and external life, and allow you to cope with difficulties that come your way. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=476))
- Other parts, however, have taken on more extreme roles in a desperate attempt to protect you from pain, vulnerability, or harm. **In IFS, an extreme role amounts to any action, feeling or thought that is dysfunctional**. Quite simply, a part playing an extreme role causes problems in your life; it hampers it at best and cripples it at worst. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=479))
- There are **two kinds of extreme parts—protectors and exiles**. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=491))
- The job of **protectors** is to **protect you from feeling pain**. They try to **arrange your life and your psyche so that you are always in a kind of comfort zone** and you never feel hurt, shame, or fear. They attempt to protect you from hurtful incidents or distressing relationships in your current life that could **bring up buried pain from childhood**. Since this can be intense, protectors are keen on preventing it from being activated. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=492))
- Protectors **don’t realize that you aren’t a child anymore**. They don’t realize that you have many more strengths and resources now, and you usually aren’t in danger as you were in the past. They try to avoid any situation that is similar to what you experienced as a child. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=500)) ^b7661b
- [ ] ==Exercise: Learning about Protectors Think about two of your protectors. For each one, write out answers to the following questions: What is its role in helping you manage your life and interact with the world? How does it relate to other people? How does it protect you from pain? What is its positive intent for you? What is it trying to protect you from?== ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=531))
- Exiles are young child parts that are in pain from the past. While protectors try to keep us from feeling pain, exiles are the parts in pain. They are the ones the protectors are trying to protect us from. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=538))
- Exiles are often stuck at a particular time in childhood, at a specific age. They are literally two years old, or five or seven, and they exist in a situation from that time in your life. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=540))
- If your family life was chaotic, you will probably have an exile that feels jumbled inside. If your family treated each other with cold silence most of the time, you may have an ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=553))
- In addition to painful emotions, exiles have negative beliefs about you and about the world. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=561))
- Because exiles hold pain from your past, they are pushed away by protectors. They are exiled from your inner life and kept in dark dungeons away from the light of consciousness. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=565))
- An exile is usually caught in its own little world and is unaware that you have grown up and developed the capacity to take care of yourself, make friends, be independent, and perhaps start your own family. All it is aware of is a certain painful situation from your early life. Whenever something happens in the present that is similar, it reactivates that pain, which comes bubbling up toward the surface. Then your protectors go into high gear to prevent you from having to feel ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=566))
- Exercise: Learning about Exiles Think about two of your exiles. For each one, please write out the answers to the following questions: What emotions does it feel? What pain does it carry? What is it afraid of? What negative beliefs does it have? What situation or relationship is it stuck in from childhood? What current situations tend to trigger it? What protectors come up when that happens? ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=593))
- We all have a core part of us that is our true self, our spiritual center. When our extreme parts are not activated and in the way, this is who we are. The Self is relaxed, open, and accepting of yourself and others. When you are in Self, you are grounded, centered, and non-reactive. You don’t get triggered by what people do. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=611))
- Let’s look at four qualities of the Self that are particularly important for psychological healing. When you are in Self, you will naturally embody these qualities. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=628))
- The Self is connected. When you are in Self, you naturally feel close to other people and want to relate in harmonious, supportive ways. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=629))
- The Self also wants to be connected to your parts. When you are in Self, you are interested in having a relationship with each of your parts, which helps them to trust you, opening the way for healing. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=631))
- The Self is curious. When you are in Self, you are curious about other people in an open, accepting way. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=632))
- The Self is compassionate. Compassion is a form of kindness and love that arises when people are in pain. You genuinely care about how they feel and want to support them through difficult times. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=637))
- The Self is calm, centered, and grounded. This is especially helpful when you are relating to a part that has intense emotions. Intense grief or shame, for example, can be overwhelming if you aren’t grounded in Self, and protectors will avoid a part that has emotions like this at all costs. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=642))
- There are two goals for IFS therapy: one, heal your parts so that their extreme roles are converted to healthy roles, and two, help them to cooperate with each other under the leadership of the Self. ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=666))
- Parts aren’t defined by the negative beliefs and emotions they took on in childhood, which IFS calls their burdens. They have their own potential that is intrinsic to them. That is why they can let go of a burden and take on a new role in the psyche. ([Location 940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=940))
- IFS has discovered that it is helpful to release a burden to one of the basic elements in nature—earth, fire, wind, water, or light. This signifies that the burden won’t come back because it has been carried away, or transformed, by something elemental and powerful. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=949))
- The IFS process is actually quite efficient and penetrating, but, paradoxically, it does this by being careful and respectful of protectors, not through strong-arm tactics. Furthermore, protectors are important in themselves. Since exiles are pushed into the background, it is the protectors that are out front relating to people and acting in the world. It isn’t enough to heal our exiles; our protectors must also be healed and transformed so they can drop their defensive roles, let their positive qualities emerge, and assume healthy roles in the inner system. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=997))
- The steps for getting to know a protector can be summarized as follows: In beginning a session, you access a number of protectors and then choose one to focus on, called the target part. You inhabit Self and get to know this protector, finding out its positive intent for you. You establish a trusting relationship with the protector and understand what it is trying to protect you from. This sets the stage for further work with the protector or for healing the exile it is protecting. ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1004))

- IFS distinguishes between two types of protectors—proactive managers and reactive firefighters—but there isn’t space to go into that distinction in this book. ([Location 5406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=5406))

> However, if we treat them like little beings inside of us who have our best interests at heart, we become open to a brand new way of relating to our feelings. We can get to know them, understand what drives them, and actually befriend them. When this happens, these parts will change, so they don’t have to overeat or flip out in rage anymore. They can relax and act sensibly. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=195)) ^rw165931526

> The human mind isn’t a unitary thing that sometimes has irrational feelings. It is a complex system of interacting parts, each with a mind of its own. It’s like an internal family--with wounded children, impulsive teenagers, rigid adults, hypercritical parents, caring friends, nurturing relatives, and so on. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=206)) ^rw165931527

> Underlying this cast of characters, every human being has a true Self that is wise, deep, open, and loving. This is who we truly are when we aren’t being hijacked by painful or defensive voices. The Self is the key to healing and integrating our disparate parts through its compassion, curiosity, and connectedness. It is also the natural leader of our inner family, a guide through the adventures of life. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=290)) ^rw165931528

> Let’s suppose you have an issue you would like to work on. How do you know what parts to explore? In this section, we will show you how to determine which parts are involved with an issue. In IFS, issues are sometimes referred to as trailheads. A trailhead is an experience or a difficulty in your life that will lead to interesting parts if you follow it. It can be a situation or person that you react to, an emotional or bodily experience, a pattern of behavior or thinking, a dream, or anything else that indicates parts to explore. We call it a trailhead because it is the beginning of a trail that can lead to healing. It usually involves both a life situation and your response to that situation. ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1026)) ^rw305609577

> When you are at a trailhead, there is at least one part activated and often more than one. For example, when I am in a large group of strangers, I have at least three parts activated—one that is scared of being hurt, another part that wants to withdraw to protect me, and a third part that wants to reach out and talk to people despite the fear. ([Location 1046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1046)) ^rw305609578 identify with this

> You are likely to have at least one emotional reaction to the trailhead situation, perhaps more than one. You may feel angry, sad, or afraid, for example. In addition, you may notice certain attitudes you have in that situation; you may feel judgmental, thoughtless, stingy, careful, zany, doubtful, or mischievous. Each feeling, emotion, or attitude indicates the presence of a part, except for those attitudes that come from the Self, such as being kind or centered. Furthermore, if you feel cut off from your feelings, that is probably caused by a part. For example, if you feel dead, closed, or cold in a trailhead situation, there probably is a part causing this.

> Most body sensations that come up in response to a trailhead are related to parts. The exceptions are purely physiological sensations (like a stomachache because of something you ate) and the bodily experiences of Self, such as feeling peaceful, open, or energetic.

> An action or pattern of behavior can indicate a part—for example, withdrawing or becoming pushy. The avoidance of behavior also indicates a part. ([Location 1068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1068)) ^rw305609582

> Let’s look at a more detailed example of a trailhead. When Betty visited her grown son’s house, she felt that he was being verbally abusive to his son, and she was considering talking to him about this but kept hesitating.

> Choose a trailhead that you are interested in exploring. Using the approach described above, make a list of each of the parts involved with that trailhead.

> Go inside and make contact with it experientially, through your emotions, images, body sensations, and internal voices. There are a variety of internal channels for accessing a part: ([Location 1107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1107)) ^rw305609587

> However, it isn’t necessary to use many channels to access a part; just one is enough. ([Location 1132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1132)) ^rw305609595

> activated because of a situation you are in or are thinking about. Each activated part influences your feelings, your body, your thoughts, and your behavior. The rest of your parts are dormant but can be activated at any moment. ([Location 1139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1139)) ^rw305609596

> Parts become activated according to external situations or internal memories or thoughts. If you are relating to a person or dealing with an event that seems dangerous to one of your parts, it will activate and take over your psyche to protect you. ([Location 1144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1144)) ^rw305609597

> When you decide to access a part, it may already be activated at that moment, or it may be dormant. Access is done a little differently in each case. ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1150)) ^rw305609598

> Access is like shining the flashlight of consciousness on that part. ([Location 1152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1152)) ^rw305609599

> However, even if a part is not activated, you can still access it and work with it. You just need to activate the part first. A good way to do this is to remember a recent time when it was activated and imagine that you are in that situation now.

> At any given moment, a trailhead may or may not be activated, just like a part. If it is activated, you will feel your reaction to it. When you want to explore a trailhead that isn’t activated at the moment, imagine a recent time when that trailhead was active and notice how you feel inside. Or notice how you usually feel when that trailhead is activated. Then you can access all the parts related to it. ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1235)) ^rw305609602

> For each part, write down what you experience: Name of part What it feels emotionally What it looks like What it feels like in your body and where What it says ([Location 1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1260)) ^rw305609603

> At the beginning of an IFS session, you may want to discuss an issue in your life or talk about some parts you are aware of. Pretty soon, however, this purely intellectual understanding ceases to be of much value. It is time to go inside and explore yourself experientially. Your goal will be to focus on one part to get to know in some depth (as you will learn how to do over the rest of the book). This is called the target part. You have three options for going about this: Start with a part you already know about and access it. Access all the parts activated at the current moment and then choose one to focus on. Start with a trailhead. Analyze it to see what parts are related to it and then choose one to access. Or access all the parts related to the trailhead experientially and then choose one. Once you start working with a part, others may get activated that you must deal with. Sometimes you will continue to work with the original target part, and sometimes you will change your focus to one of them. ([Location 1265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1265)) ^rw305609604

> At any point in the day when you notice that a part is activated, you can briefly access it and pay attention to how it is affecting you. This gives you information about how often it is triggered, under what circumstances, and how it affects your emotions, your behavior, and your life. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1282)) ^rw305609605

> At the end of each day, take a few minutes to review the day for moments when the part was activated. Add to your notes at this time. This daily review will also help you to keep this exercise in mind the next day. Notes to take each time it happens: Situation How you experience the part What about this situation triggered the part ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1298)) ^rw305609606

> We can explain this in another way using the concept of the seat of consciousness. We each have a place in our psyche that determines our identity, choices, feelings, and perceptions. This seat can be occupied by Self or by a part. Whoever resides in the seat of consciousness at any given moment is in charge of our psyche at that time. Whether it is a part or the Self, the occupant of the seat determines how we feel, what our intentions are, how we perceive other people, how we relate to them, and what our choices and actions will be. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1322)) ^rw305609607 this is an interesting mental model, and sure it does counter somewhat with buddhism - but on another level it can be considered in alignment with buddhism, especially with burbea’s idea of “ways of seeing”
> more i think about it the more it seems correct in some fundamental way. the Self is different than no-self in buddhism, but in another way it’s a capitalized Self and makes sense, and is omnipresent - a deeper consciousness, we’re not trying to eradicate selfhood, are we? just ego and trappings of considering solid self - but actually considering this fluid and being able to step back to a Self - very beautiful

> The Self is the natural occupant of the seat of consciousness because it is who we truly are. It is our essential nature, our spiritual center. This means that the Self occupies the seat of consciousness unless a part (such as Sheila’s Temper Tantrum Part) takes over the seat and pushes the Self into the background. Then that part is in charge of your psyche for a while. This can happen in an instant and usually without our realizing it. ([Location 1338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1338)) ^rw318708858 analogous to papanca?

> This example shows the two most common ways we relate to our difficult parts—either we are blended with them or we judge them. However, neither attitude is helpful in getting to know a part and connecting with it. To do that successfully, you must be centered in Self so you can relate to the part with curiosity and compassion. ([Location 1361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1361)) ^rw318708859

> IFS distinguishes between two types of protectors—proactive managers and reactive firefighters—but there isn’t space to go into that distinction in this book. ([Location 5406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=5406)) ^rw171620131

## Highlights

- improved the effectiveness of my work with clients. IFS was so good that I switched over to practicing it almost exclusively, and it has enabled my clients ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=125))
- appreciation for how profound it is. Recently I was impressed with how it helps my clients approach ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=128))
- However, if we treat them like little beings inside of us who have our best interests at heart, we become open to a brand new way of relating to our feelings. We can get to know them, understand what drives them, and actually befriend them. When this happens, these parts will change, so they don’t have to overeat or flip out in rage anymore. They can relax and act sensibly. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=195))
- The human mind isn’t a unitary thing that sometimes has irrational feelings. It is a complex system of interacting parts, each with a mind of its own. It’s like an internal family--with wounded children, impulsive teenagers, rigid adults, hypercritical parents, caring friends, nurturing relatives, and so on. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=206))
- Underlying this cast of characters, every human being has a true Self that is wise, deep, open, and loving. This is who we truly are when we aren’t being hijacked by painful or defensive voices. The Self is the key to healing and integrating our disparate parts through its compassion, curiosity, and connectedness. It is also the natural leader of our inner family, a guide through the adventures of life. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=290))
- Because over the years we have experienced hurts, trauma, and grief, which have burdened us with shame, fear, and negative beliefs. These events have prompted some of our inner characters to take over in a desperate bid to protect us from harm. They blot out our pain, and, in the process, the light of the Self gets dimmed or lost. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=294))
- Experience with IFS shows that every part has a positive intent for you. It may want to protect you from harm or help you feel good about yourself. It may want to keep you from feeling pain or make other people like you. Every part of you is trying to help you feel good and avoid pain. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=306))
- You can’t get rid of a part of your psyche. You can only push it into the unconscious, where it will continue to affect you without your awareness. In IFS, we do something altogether different and radical. We welcome all our parts with curiosity and compassion. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=334))
- Chapter 2 Your Internal System Summary of the IFS Model This chapter introduces you to the IFS model, developed by psychologist Richard Schwartz, and gives a quick overview of how it works. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=440))
- Parts are entities of their own, with their own feelings, beliefs, motivations, and memories. It is especially important to understand that parts have motivations for everything they do. Nothing is just done out of habit. Nothing is just a pattern of thinking or behavior you learned. Everything (except for purely physiological reactions) is done by a part for a reason, even though that reason may be unconscious. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=450))
- Understanding the psyche in this way gives you a great deal of power to change your inner world for the better. Since parts are like little people inside you, you can make contact with them, get to know them, negotiate with them, encourage them to trust you, help them communicate with each other, and give them what they need to heal. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=454))
- Many parts perform roles that are healthy and functional. They make sure your life works well. They may help you connect with people or get work done. They may help you assert yourself or comprehend the world. Many parts have positive qualities that enhance your inner experience and external life, and allow you to cope with difficulties that come your way. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=476))
- Other parts, however, have taken on more extreme roles in a desperate attempt to protect you from pain, vulnerability, or harm. In IFS, an extreme role amounts to any action, feeling or thought that is dysfunctional. Quite simply, a part playing an extreme role causes problems in your life; it hampers it at best and cripples it at worst. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=479))
- There are two kinds of extreme parts—protectors and exiles. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=491))
- The job of protectors[1] is to protect you from feeling pain. They try to arrange your life and your psyche so that you are always in a kind of comfort zone and you never feel hurt, shame, or fear. They attempt to protect you from hurtful incidents or distressing relationships in your current life that could bring up buried pain from childhood. Since this can be intense, protectors are keen on preventing it from being activated. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=492))
- Protectors don’t realize that you aren’t a child anymore. They don’t realize that you have many more strengths and resources now, and you usually aren’t in danger as you were in the past. They try to avoid any situation that is similar to what you experienced as a child. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=500))
- In standard psychological language, these protectors are called “defenses.” ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=505))
- Exercise: Learning about Protectors Think about two of your protectors. For each one, write out answers to the following questions: What is its role in helping you manage your life and interact with the world? How does it relate to other people? How does it protect you from pain? What is its positive intent for you? What is it trying to protect you from? ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=531))
- Exiles are young child parts that are in pain from the past. While protectors try to keep us from feeling pain, exiles are the parts in pain. They are the ones the protectors are trying to protect us from. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=538))
- Exiles are often stuck at a particular time in childhood, at a specific age. They are literally two years old, or five or seven, and they exist in a situation from that time in your life. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=540))
- If your family life was chaotic, you will probably have an exile that feels jumbled inside. If your family treated each other with cold silence most of the time, you may have an ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=553))
- In addition to painful emotions, exiles have negative beliefs about you and about the world. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=561))
- Because exiles hold pain from your past, they are pushed away by protectors. They are exiled from your inner life and kept in dark dungeons away from the light of consciousness. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=565))
- An exile is usually caught in its own little world and is unaware that you have grown up and developed the capacity to take care of yourself, make friends, be independent, and perhaps start your own family. All it is aware of is a certain painful situation from your early life. Whenever something happens in the present that is similar, it reactivates that pain, which comes bubbling up toward the surface. Then your protectors go into high gear to prevent you from having to feel ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=566))
- Exercise: Learning about Exiles Think about two of your exiles. For each one, please write out the answers to the following questions: What emotions does it feel? What pain does it carry? What is it afraid of? What negative beliefs does it have? What situation or relationship is it stuck in from childhood? What current situations tend to trigger it? What protectors come up when that happens? ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=593))
- We all have a core part of us that is our true self, our spiritual center. When our extreme parts are not activated and in the way, this is who we are. The Self is relaxed, open, and accepting of yourself and others. When you are in Self, you are grounded, centered, and non-reactive. You don’t get triggered by what people do. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=611))
- Let’s look at four qualities of the Self that are particularly important for psychological healing. When you are in Self, you will naturally embody these qualities. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=628))
- The Self is connected. When you are in Self, you naturally feel close to other people and want to relate in harmonious, supportive ways. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=629))
- The Self also wants to be connected to your parts. When you are in Self, you are interested in having a relationship with each of your parts, which helps them to trust you, opening the way for healing. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=631))
- The Self is curious. When you are in Self, you are curious about other people in an open, accepting way. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=632))
- The Self is compassionate. Compassion is a form of kindness and love that arises when people are in pain. You genuinely care about how they feel and want to support them through difficult times. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=637))
- The Self is calm, centered, and grounded. This is especially helpful when you are relating to a part that has intense emotions. Intense grief or shame, for example, can be overwhelming if you aren’t grounded in Self, and protectors will avoid a part that has emotions like this at all costs. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=642))
- There are two goals for IFS therapy: one, heal your parts so that their extreme roles are converted to healthy roles, and two, help them to cooperate with each other under the leadership of the Self. ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=666))
- Parts aren’t defined by the negative beliefs and emotions they took on in childhood, which IFS calls their burdens. They have their own potential that is intrinsic to them. That is why they can let go of a burden and take on a new role in the psyche. ([Location 940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=940))
- IFS has discovered that it is helpful to release a burden to one of the basic elements in nature—earth, fire, wind, water, or light. This signifies that the burden won’t come back because it has been carried away, or transformed, by something elemental and powerful. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=949))
- The IFS process is actually quite efficient and penetrating, but, paradoxically, it does this by being careful and respectful of protectors, not through strong-arm tactics. Furthermore, protectors are important in themselves. Since exiles are pushed into the background, it is the protectors that are out front relating to people and acting in the world. It isn’t enough to heal our exiles; our protectors must also be healed and transformed so they can drop their defensive roles, let their positive qualities emerge, and assume healthy roles in the inner system. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=997))
- The steps for getting to know a protector can be summarized as follows: In beginning a session, you access a number of protectors and then choose one to focus on, called the target part. You inhabit Self and get to know this protector, finding out its positive intent for you. You establish a trusting relationship with the protector and understand what it is trying to protect you from. This sets the stage for further work with the protector or for healing the exile it is protecting. ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1004))
  - mw:: Feels similar to focusing
- P5. “P” stands for protector. These steps constitute the content of Part I. P1: Accessing a part P2: Unblending from the target part P3: Unblending from a concerned part P4: Discovering a protector’s role P5: Developing a trusting relationship with a protector ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1008))
- Let’s suppose you have an issue you would like to work on. How do you know what parts to explore? In this section, we will show you how to determine which parts are involved with an issue. In IFS, issues are sometimes referred to as trailheads. A trailhead is an experience or a difficulty in your life that will lead to interesting parts if you follow it. It can be a situation or person that you react to, an emotional or bodily experience, a pattern of behavior or thinking, a dream, or anything else that indicates parts to explore. We call it a trailhead because it is the beginning of a trail that can lead to healing. It usually involves both a life situation and your response to that situation. ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1026))
- When you are at a trailhead, there is at least one part activated and often more than one. For example, when I am in a large group of strangers, I have at least three parts activated—one that is scared of being hurt, another part that wants to withdraw to protect me, and a third part that wants to reach out and talk to people despite the fear. ([Location 1046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1046))
  - mw:: identify with this
- You are likely to have at least one emotional reaction to the trailhead situation, perhaps more than one. You may feel angry, sad, or afraid, for example. In addition, you may notice certain attitudes you have in that situation; you may feel judgmental, thoughtless, stingy, careful, zany, doubtful, or mischievous. Each feeling, emotion, or attitude indicates the presence of a part, except for those attitudes that come from the Self, such as being kind or centered. Furthermore, if you feel cut off from your feelings, that is probably caused by a part. For example, if you feel dead, closed, or cold in a trailhead situation, there probably is a part causing this. ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1053))
- Most body sensations that come up in response to a trailhead are related to parts. The exceptions are purely physiological sensations (like a stomachache because of something you ate) and the bodily experiences of Self, such as feeling peaceful, open, or energetic. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1058))
- Many thoughts that arise in response to a trailhead situation come from parts. ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1063))
- An action or pattern of behavior can indicate a part—for example, withdrawing or becoming pushy. The avoidance of behavior also indicates a part. ([Location 1068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1068))
- Certain types of desires come from a part. One part may want closeness or success. Another might want to be seen and appreciated. A third might want to be left alone. ([Location 1070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1070))
- Let’s look at a more detailed example of a trailhead. When Betty visited her grown son’s house, she felt that he was being verbally abusive to his son, and she was considering talking to him about this but kept hesitating. ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1072))
  - mw:: six different parts based on emotions/desires/xensations
- Choose a trailhead that you are interested in exploring. Using the approach described above, make a list of each of the parts involved with that trailhead. For each part, write the following if you can: Name of part What it feels emotionally What it looks like What it feels like in your body and where What it says How it makes you behave What it wants ([Location 1091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1091))
- Step P1: Accessing a Part ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1101))
- Go inside and make contact with it experientially, through your emotions, images, body sensations, and internal voices. There are a variety of internal channels for accessing a part: ([Location 1107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1107))
- Feelings. ([Location 1108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1108))
- Body Sensations. ([Location 1109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1109))
- Images. ([Location 1110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1110))
- Internal Voice. ([Location 1114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1114))
- Written Dialogue. ([Location 1116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1116))
- Speaking as the Part.. ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1117))
- Direct Knowing. ([Location 1118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1118))
- However, it isn’t necessary to use many channels to access a part; just one is enough. ([Location 1132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1132))
- activated because of a situation you are in or are thinking about. Each activated part influences your feelings, your body, your thoughts, and your behavior. The rest of your parts are dormant but can be activated at any moment. ([Location 1139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1139))
- Parts become activated according to external situations or internal memories or thoughts. If you are relating to a person or dealing with an event that seems dangerous to one of your parts, it will activate and take over your psyche to protect you. ([Location 1144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1144))
- When you decide to access a part, it may already be activated at that moment, or it may be dormant. Access is done a little differently in each case. ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1150))
- Access is like shining the flashlight of consciousness on that part. ([Location 1152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1152))
- However, even if a part is not activated, you can still access it and work with it. You just need to activate the part first. A good way to do this is to remember a recent time when it was activated and imagine that you are in that situation now. ([Location 1154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1154))
- G: Male, huge, totally black, strong. ([Location 1198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1198))
  - mw:: jfc with this racist bullshit
- At any given moment, a trailhead may or may not be activated, just like a part. If it is activated, you will feel your reaction to it. When you want to explore a trailhead that isn’t activated at the moment, imagine a recent time when that trailhead was active and notice how you feel inside. Or notice how you usually feel when that trailhead is activated. Then you can access all the parts related to it. ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1235))
- For each part, write down what you experience: Name of part What it feels emotionally What it looks like What it feels like in your body and where What it says ([Location 1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1260))
- At the beginning of an IFS session, you may want to discuss an issue in your life or talk about some parts you are aware of. Pretty soon, however, this purely intellectual understanding ceases to be of much value. It is time to go inside and explore yourself experientially. Your goal will be to focus on one part to get to know in some depth (as you will learn how to do over the rest of the book). This is called the target part. You have three options for going about this: Start with a part you already know about and access it. Access all the parts activated at the current moment and then choose one to focus on. Start with a trailhead. Analyze it to see what parts are related to it and then choose one to access. Or access all the parts related to the trailhead experientially and then choose one. Once you start working with a part, others may get activated that you must deal with. Sometimes you will continue to work with the original target part, and sometimes you will change your focus to one of them. ([Location 1265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1265))
- At any point in the day when you notice that a part is activated, you can briefly access it and pay attention to how it is affecting you. This gives you information about how often it is triggered, under what circumstances, and how it affects your emotions, your behavior, and your life. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1282))
- At the end of each day, take a few minutes to review the day for moments when the part was activated. Add to your notes at this time. This daily review will also help you to keep this exercise in mind the next day. Notes to take each time it happens: Situation How you experience the part What about this situation triggered the part ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1298))
- We can explain this in another way using the concept of the seat of consciousness. We each have a place in our psyche that determines our identity, choices, feelings, and perceptions. This seat can be occupied by Self or by a part. Whoever resides in the seat of consciousness at any given moment is in charge of our psyche at that time. Whether it is a part or the Self, the occupant of the seat determines how we feel, what our intentions are, how we perceive other people, how we relate to them, and what our choices and actions will be. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1322))
  - mw:: this is an interesting mental model, and sure it does counter somewhat with buddhism - but on another level it can be considered in alignment with buddhism, especially with burbea’s idea of “ways of seeing”
    more i think about it the more it seems correct in some fundamental way. the Self is different than no-self in buddhism, but in another way it’s a capitalized Self and makes sense, and is omnipresent - a deeper consciousness, we’re not trying to eradicate selfhood, are we? just ego and trappings of considering solid self - but actually considering this fluid and being able to step back to a Self - very beautiful
- The Self is the natural occupant of the seat of consciousness because it is who we truly are. It is our essential nature, our spiritual center. This means that the Self occupies the seat of consciousness unless a part (such as Sheila’s Temper Tantrum Part) takes over the seat and pushes the Self into the background. Then that part is in charge of your psyche for a while. This can happen in an instant and usually without our realizing it. ([Location 1338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1338))
  - mw:: analogous to papanca?
- This example shows the two most common ways we relate to our difficult parts—either we are blended with them or we judge them. However, neither attitude is helpful in getting to know a part and connecting with it. To do that successfully, you must be centered in Self so you can relate to the part with curiosity and compassion.

## Highlights

- improved the effectiveness of my work with clients. IFS was so good that I switched over to practicing it almost exclusively, and it has enabled my clients ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=125))
- appreciation for how profound it is. Recently I was impressed with how it helps my clients approach ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=128))
- However, if we treat them like little beings inside of us who have our best interests at heart, we become open to a brand new way of relating to our feelings. We can get to know them, understand what drives them, and actually befriend them. When this happens, these parts will change, so they don’t have to overeat or flip out in rage anymore. They can relax and act sensibly. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=195))
- The human mind isn’t a unitary thing that sometimes has irrational feelings. It is a complex system of interacting parts, each with a mind of its own. It’s like an internal family--with wounded children, impulsive teenagers, rigid adults, hypercritical parents, caring friends, nurturing relatives, and so on. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=206))
- Underlying this cast of characters, every human being has a true Self that is wise, deep, open, and loving. This is who we truly are when we aren’t being hijacked by painful or defensive voices. The Self is the key to healing and integrating our disparate parts through its compassion, curiosity, and connectedness. It is also the natural leader of our inner family, a guide through the adventures of life. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=290))
- Because over the years we have experienced hurts, trauma, and grief, which have burdened us with shame, fear, and negative beliefs. These events have prompted some of our inner characters to take over in a desperate bid to protect us from harm. They blot out our pain, and, in the process, the light of the Self gets dimmed or lost. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=294))
- Experience with IFS shows that every part has a positive intent for you. It may want to protect you from harm or help you feel good about yourself. It may want to keep you from feeling pain or make other people like you. Every part of you is trying to help you feel good and avoid pain. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=306))
- You can’t get rid of a part of your psyche. You can only push it into the unconscious, where it will continue to affect you without your awareness. In IFS, we do something altogether different and radical. We welcome all our parts with curiosity and compassion. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=334))
- Chapter 2 Your Internal System Summary of the IFS Model This chapter introduces you to the IFS model, developed by psychologist Richard Schwartz, and gives a quick overview of how it works. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=440))
- Parts are entities of their own, with their own feelings, beliefs, motivations, and memories. It is especially important to understand that parts have motivations for everything they do. Nothing is just done out of habit. Nothing is just a pattern of thinking or behavior you learned. Everything (except for purely physiological reactions) is done by a part for a reason, even though that reason may be unconscious. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=450))
- Understanding the psyche in this way gives you a great deal of power to change your inner world for the better. Since parts are like little people inside you, you can make contact with them, get to know them, negotiate with them, encourage them to trust you, help them communicate with each other, and give them what they need to heal. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=454))
- Many parts perform roles that are healthy and functional. They make sure your life works well. They may help you connect with people or get work done. They may help you assert yourself or comprehend the world. Many parts have positive qualities that enhance your inner experience and external life, and allow you to cope with difficulties that come your way. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=476))
- Other parts, however, have taken on more extreme roles in a desperate attempt to protect you from pain, vulnerability, or harm. In IFS, an extreme role amounts to any action, feeling or thought that is dysfunctional. Quite simply, a part playing an extreme role causes problems in your life; it hampers it at best and cripples it at worst. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=479))
- There are two kinds of extreme parts—protectors and exiles. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=491))
- The job of protectors[1] is to protect you from feeling pain. They try to arrange your life and your psyche so that you are always in a kind of comfort zone and you never feel hurt, shame, or fear. They attempt to protect you from hurtful incidents or distressing relationships in your current life that could bring up buried pain from childhood. Since this can be intense, protectors are keen on preventing it from being activated. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=492))
- Protectors don’t realize that you aren’t a child anymore. They don’t realize that you have many more strengths and resources now, and you usually aren’t in danger as you were in the past. They try to avoid any situation that is similar to what you experienced as a child. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=500))
- In standard psychological language, these protectors are called “defenses.” ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=505))
- Exercise: Learning about Protectors Think about two of your protectors. For each one, write out answers to the following questions: What is its role in helping you manage your life and interact with the world? How does it relate to other people? How does it protect you from pain? What is its positive intent for you? What is it trying to protect you from? ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=531))
- Exiles are young child parts that are in pain from the past. While protectors try to keep us from feeling pain, exiles are the parts in pain. They are the ones the protectors are trying to protect us from. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=538))
- Exiles are often stuck at a particular time in childhood, at a specific age. They are literally two years old, or five or seven, and they exist in a situation from that time in your life. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=540))
- If your family life was chaotic, you will probably have an exile that feels jumbled inside. If your family treated each other with cold silence most of the time, you may have an ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=553))
- In addition to painful emotions, exiles have negative beliefs about you and about the world. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=561))
- Because exiles hold pain from your past, they are pushed away by protectors. They are exiled from your inner life and kept in dark dungeons away from the light of consciousness. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=565))
- An exile is usually caught in its own little world and is unaware that you have grown up and developed the capacity to take care of yourself, make friends, be independent, and perhaps start your own family. All it is aware of is a certain painful situation from your early life. Whenever something happens in the present that is similar, it reactivates that pain, which comes bubbling up toward the surface. Then your protectors go into high gear to prevent you from having to feel ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=566))
- Exercise: Learning about Exiles Think about two of your exiles. For each one, please write out the answers to the following questions: What emotions does it feel? What pain does it carry? What is it afraid of? What negative beliefs does it have? What situation or relationship is it stuck in from childhood? What current situations tend to trigger it? What protectors come up when that happens? ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=593))
- We all have a core part of us that is our true self, our spiritual center. When our extreme parts are not activated and in the way, this is who we are. The Self is relaxed, open, and accepting of yourself and others. When you are in Self, you are grounded, centered, and non-reactive. You don’t get triggered by what people do. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=611))
- Let’s look at four qualities of the Self that are particularly important for psychological healing. When you are in Self, you will naturally embody these qualities. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=628))
- The Self is connected. When you are in Self, you naturally feel close to other people and want to relate in harmonious, supportive ways. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=629))
- The Self also wants to be connected to your parts. When you are in Self, you are interested in having a relationship with each of your parts, which helps them to trust you, opening the way for healing. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=631))
- The Self is curious. When you are in Self, you are curious about other people in an open, accepting way. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=632))
- The Self is compassionate. Compassion is a form of kindness and love that arises when people are in pain. You genuinely care about how they feel and want to support them through difficult times. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=637))
- The Self is calm, centered, and grounded. This is especially helpful when you are relating to a part that has intense emotions. Intense grief or shame, for example, can be overwhelming if you aren’t grounded in Self, and protectors will avoid a part that has emotions like this at all costs. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=642))
- There are two goals for IFS therapy: one, heal your parts so that their extreme roles are converted to healthy roles, and two, help them to cooperate with each other under the leadership of the Self. ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=666))
- Parts aren’t defined by the negative beliefs and emotions they took on in childhood, which IFS calls their burdens. They have their own potential that is intrinsic to them. That is why they can let go of a burden and take on a new role in the psyche. ([Location 940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=940))
- IFS has discovered that it is helpful to release a burden to one of the basic elements in nature—earth, fire, wind, water, or light. This signifies that the burden won’t come back because it has been carried away, or transformed, by something elemental and powerful. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=949))
- The IFS process is actually quite efficient and penetrating, but, paradoxically, it does this by being careful and respectful of protectors, not through strong-arm tactics. Furthermore, protectors are important in themselves. Since exiles are pushed into the background, it is the protectors that are out front relating to people and acting in the world. It isn’t enough to heal our exiles; our protectors must also be healed and transformed so they can drop their defensive roles, let their positive qualities emerge, and assume healthy roles in the inner system. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=997))
- The steps for getting to know a protector can be summarized as follows: In beginning a session, you access a number of protectors and then choose one to focus on, called the target part. You inhabit Self and get to know this protector, finding out its positive intent for you. You establish a trusting relationship with the protector and understand what it is trying to protect you from. This sets the stage for further work with the protector or for healing the exile it is protecting. ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1004))
  - mw:: Feels similar to focusing
- P5. “P” stands for protector. These steps constitute the content of Part I. P1: Accessing a part P2: Unblending from the target part P3: Unblending from a concerned part P4: Discovering a protector’s role P5: Developing a trusting relationship with a protector ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1008))
- Let’s suppose you have an issue you would like to work on. How do you know what parts to explore? In this section, we will show you how to determine which parts are involved with an issue. In IFS, issues are sometimes referred to as trailheads. A trailhead is an experience or a difficulty in your life that will lead to interesting parts if you follow it. It can be a situation or person that you react to, an emotional or bodily experience, a pattern of behavior or thinking, a dream, or anything else that indicates parts to explore. We call it a trailhead because it is the beginning of a trail that can lead to healing. It usually involves both a life situation and your response to that situation. ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1026))
- When you are at a trailhead, there is at least one part activated and often more than one. For example, when I am in a large group of strangers, I have at least three parts activated—one that is scared of being hurt, another part that wants to withdraw to protect me, and a third part that wants to reach out and talk to people despite the fear. ([Location 1046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1046))
  - mw:: identify with this
- You are likely to have at least one emotional reaction to the trailhead situation, perhaps more than one. You may feel angry, sad, or afraid, for example. In addition, you may notice certain attitudes you have in that situation; you may feel judgmental, thoughtless, stingy, careful, zany, doubtful, or mischievous. Each feeling, emotion, or attitude indicates the presence of a part, except for those attitudes that come from the Self, such as being kind or centered. Furthermore, if you feel cut off from your feelings, that is probably caused by a part. For example, if you feel dead, closed, or cold in a trailhead situation, there probably is a part causing this. ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1053))
- Most body sensations that come up in response to a trailhead are related to parts. The exceptions are purely physiological sensations (like a stomachache because of something you ate) and the bodily experiences of Self, such as feeling peaceful, open, or energetic. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1058))
- Many thoughts that arise in response to a trailhead situation come from parts. ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1063))
- An action or pattern of behavior can indicate a part—for example, withdrawing or becoming pushy. The avoidance of behavior also indicates a part. ([Location 1068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1068))
- Certain types of desires come from a part. One part may want closeness or success. Another might want to be seen and appreciated. A third might want to be left alone. ([Location 1070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1070))
- Let’s look at a more detailed example of a trailhead. When Betty visited her grown son’s house, she felt that he was being verbally abusive to his son, and she was considering talking to him about this but kept hesitating. ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1072))

- activated because of a situation you are in or are thinking about. Each activated part influences your feelings, your body, your thoughts, and your behavior. The rest of your parts are dormant but can be activated at any moment. ([Location 1139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1139))
- Parts become activated according to external situations or internal memories or thoughts. If you are relating to a person or dealing with an event that seems dangerous to one of your parts, it will activate and take over your psyche to protect you. ([Location 1144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1144))
- When you decide to access a part, it may already be activated at that moment, or it may be dormant. Access is done a little differently in each case. ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1150))
- Access is like shining the flashlight of consciousness on that part. ([Location 1152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1152))
- However, even if a part is not activated, you can still access it and work with it. You just need to activate the part first. A good way to do this is to remember a recent time when it was activated and imagine that you are in that situation now. ([Location 1154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1154))

  - mw:: jfc with this racist bullshit
- At any given moment, a trailhead may or may not be activated, just like a part. If it is activated, you will feel your reaction to it. When you want to explore a trailhead that isn’t activated at the moment, imagine a recent time when that trailhead was active and notice how you feel inside. Or notice how you usually feel when that trailhead is activated. Then you can access all the parts related to it. ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1235))
- For each part, write down what you experience: Name of part What it feels emotionally What it looks like What it feels like in your body and where What it says ([Location 1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1260))
- At the beginning of an IFS session, you may want to discuss an issue in your life or talk about some parts you are aware of. Pretty soon, however, this purely intellectual understanding ceases to be of much value. It is time to go inside and explore yourself experientially. Your goal will be to focus on one part to get to know in some depth (as you will learn how to do over the rest of the book). This is called the target part. You have three options for going about this: Start with a part you already know about and access it. Access all the parts activated at the current moment and then choose one to focus on. Start with a trailhead. Analyze it to see what parts are related to it and then choose one to access. Or access all the parts related to the trailhead experientially and then choose one. Once you start working with a part, others may get activated that you must deal with. Sometimes you will continue to work with the original target part, and sometimes you will change your focus to one of them. ([Location 1265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1265))
- At any point in the day when you notice that a part is activated, you can briefly access it and pay attention to how it is affecting you. This gives you information about how often it is triggered, under what circumstances, and how it affects your emotions, your behavior, and your life. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1282))
- At the end of each day, take a few minutes to review the day for moments when the part was activated. Add to your notes at this time. This daily review will also help you to keep this exercise in mind the next day. Notes to take each time it happens: Situation How you experience the part What about this situation triggered the part ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1298))
- We can explain this in another way using the concept of the seat of consciousness. We each have a place in our psyche that determines our identity, choices, feelings, and perceptions. This seat can be occupied by Self or by a part. Whoever resides in the seat of consciousness at any given moment is in charge of our psyche at that time. Whether it is a part or the Self, the occupant of the seat determines how we feel, what our intentions are, how we perceive other people, how we relate to them, and what our choices and actions will be. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1322))
  - mw:: this is an interesting mental model, and sure it does counter somewhat with buddhism - but on another level it can be considered in alignment with buddhism, especially with burbea’s idea of “ways of seeing”
    more i think about it the more it seems correct in some fundamental way. the Self is different than no-self in buddhism, but in another way it’s a capitalized Self and makes sense, and is omnipresent - a deeper consciousness, we’re not trying to eradicate selfhood, are we? just ego and trappings of considering solid self - but actually considering this fluid and being able to step back to a Self - very beautiful
- The Self is the natural occupant of the seat of consciousness because it is who we truly are. It is our essential nature, our spiritual center. This means that the Self occupies the seat of consciousness unless a part (such as Sheila’s Temper Tantrum Part) takes over the seat and pushes the Self into the background. Then that part is in charge of your psyche for a while. This can happen in an instant and usually without our realizing it. ([Location 1338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1338))
  - mw:: analogous to papanca?
- This example shows the two most common ways we relate to our difficult parts—either we are blended with them or we judge them. However, neither attitude is helpful in getting to know a part and connecting with it. To do that successfully, you must be centered in Self so you can relate to the part with curiosity and compassion.

## Highlights
> improved the effectiveness of my work with clients. IFS was so good that I switched over to practicing it almost exclusively, and it has enabled my clients ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=125))

---

> appreciation for how profound it is. Recently I was impressed with how it helps my clients approach ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=128))

---

> However, if we treat them like little beings inside of us who have our best interests at heart, we become open to a brand new way of relating to our feelings. We can get to know them, understand what drives them, and actually befriend them. When this happens, these parts will change, so they don’t have to overeat or flip out in rage anymore. They can relax and act sensibly. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=195))

---

> The human mind isn’t a unitary thing that sometimes has irrational feelings. It is a complex system of interacting parts, each with a mind of its own. It’s like an internal family--with wounded children, impulsive teenagers, rigid adults, hypercritical parents, caring friends, nurturing relatives, and so on. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=206))

---

> Underlying this cast of characters, every human being has a true Self that is wise, deep, open, and loving. This is who we truly are when we aren’t being hijacked by painful or defensive voices. The Self is the key to healing and integrating our disparate parts through its compassion, curiosity, and connectedness. It is also the natural leader of our inner family, a guide through the adventures of life. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=290))

---

> Because over the years we have experienced hurts, trauma, and grief, which have burdened us with shame, fear, and negative beliefs. These events have prompted some of our inner characters to take over in a desperate bid to protect us from harm. They blot out our pain, and, in the process, the light of the Self gets dimmed or lost. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=294))

---

> Experience with IFS shows that every part has a positive intent for you. It may want to protect you from harm or help you feel good about yourself. It may want to keep you from feeling pain or make other people like you. Every part of you is trying to help you feel good and avoid pain. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=306))

---

> You can’t get rid of a part of your psyche. You can only push it into the unconscious, where it will continue to affect you without your awareness. In IFS, we do something altogether different and radical. We welcome all our parts with curiosity and compassion. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=334))

---

> Chapter 2 Your Internal System Summary of the IFS Model This chapter introduces you to the IFS model, developed by psychologist Richard Schwartz, and gives a quick overview of how it works. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=440))

---

> Parts are entities of their own, with their own feelings, beliefs, motivations, and memories. It is especially important to understand that parts have motivations for everything they do. Nothing is just done out of habit. Nothing is just a pattern of thinking or behavior you learned. Everything (except for purely physiological reactions) is done by a part for a reason, even though that reason may be unconscious. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=450))

---

> Understanding the psyche in this way gives you a great deal of power to change your inner world for the better. Since parts are like little people inside you, you can make contact with them, get to know them, negotiate with them, encourage them to trust you, help them communicate with each other, and give them what they need to heal. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=454))

---

> Many parts perform roles that are healthy and functional. They make sure your life works well. They may help you connect with people or get work done. They may help you assert yourself or comprehend the world. Many parts have positive qualities that enhance your inner experience and external life, and allow you to cope with difficulties that come your way. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=476))

---

> Other parts, however, have taken on more extreme roles in a desperate attempt to protect you from pain, vulnerability, or harm. In IFS, an extreme role amounts to any action, feeling or thought that is dysfunctional. Quite simply, a part playing an extreme role causes problems in your life; it hampers it at best and cripples it at worst. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=479))

---

> There are two kinds of extreme parts—protectors and exiles. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=491))

---

> The job of protectors[1] is to protect you from feeling pain. They try to arrange your life and your psyche so that you are always in a kind of comfort zone and you never feel hurt, shame, or fear. They attempt to protect you from hurtful incidents or distressing relationships in your current life that could bring up buried pain from childhood. Since this can be intense, protectors are keen on preventing it from being activated. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=492))

---

> Protectors don’t realize that you aren’t a child anymore. They don’t realize that you have many more strengths and resources now, and you usually aren’t in danger as you were in the past. They try to avoid any situation that is similar to what you experienced as a child. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=500))

---

> In standard psychological language, these protectors are called “defenses.” ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=505))

---

> Exercise: Learning about Protectors Think about two of your protectors. For each one, write out answers to the following questions: What is its role in helping you manage your life and interact with the world? How does it relate to other people? How does it protect you from pain? What is its positive intent for you? What is it trying to protect you from? ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=531))

---

> Exiles are young child parts that are in pain from the past. While protectors try to keep us from feeling pain, exiles are the parts in pain. They are the ones the protectors are trying to protect us from. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=538))

---

> Exiles are often stuck at a particular time in childhood, at a specific age. They are literally two years old, or five or seven, and they exist in a situation from that time in your life. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=540))

---

> If your family life was chaotic, you will probably have an exile that feels jumbled inside. If your family treated each other with cold silence most of the time, you may have an ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=553))

---

> In addition to painful emotions, exiles have negative beliefs about you and about the world. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=561))

---

> Because exiles hold pain from your past, they are pushed away by protectors. They are exiled from your inner life and kept in dark dungeons away from the light of consciousness. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=565))

---

> An exile is usually caught in its own little world and is unaware that you have grown up and developed the capacity to take care of yourself, make friends, be independent, and perhaps start your own family. All it is aware of is a certain painful situation from your early life. Whenever something happens in the present that is similar, it reactivates that pain, which comes bubbling up toward the surface. Then your protectors go into high gear to prevent you from having to feel ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=566))

---

> Exercise: Learning about Exiles Think about two of your exiles. For each one, please write out the answers to the following questions: What emotions does it feel? What pain does it carry? What is it afraid of? What negative beliefs does it have? What situation or relationship is it stuck in from childhood? What current situations tend to trigger it? What protectors come up when that happens? ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=593))

---

> We all have a core part of us that is our true self, our spiritual center. When our extreme parts are not activated and in the way, this is who we are. The Self is relaxed, open, and accepting of yourself and others. When you are in Self, you are grounded, centered, and non-reactive. You don’t get triggered by what people do. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=611))

---

> Let’s look at four qualities of the Self that are particularly important for psychological healing. When you are in Self, you will naturally embody these qualities. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=628))

---

> The Self is connected. When you are in Self, you naturally feel close to other people and want to relate in harmonious, supportive ways. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=629))

---

> The Self also wants to be connected to your parts. When you are in Self, you are interested in having a relationship with each of your parts, which helps them to trust you, opening the way for healing. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=631))

---

> The Self is curious. When you are in Self, you are curious about other people in an open, accepting way. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=632))

---

> The Self is compassionate. Compassion is a form of kindness and love that arises when people are in pain. You genuinely care about how they feel and want to support them through difficult times. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=637))

---

> The Self is calm, centered, and grounded. This is especially helpful when you are relating to a part that has intense emotions. Intense grief or shame, for example, can be overwhelming if you aren’t grounded in Self, and protectors will avoid a part that has emotions like this at all costs. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=642))

---

> There are two goals for IFS therapy: one, heal your parts so that their extreme roles are converted to healthy roles, and two, help them to cooperate with each other under the leadership of the Self. ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=666))

---

> Parts aren’t defined by the negative beliefs and emotions they took on in childhood, which IFS calls their burdens. They have their own potential that is intrinsic to them. That is why they can let go of a burden and take on a new role in the psyche. ([Location 940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=940))

---

> IFS has discovered that it is helpful to release a burden to one of the basic elements in nature—earth, fire, wind, water, or light. This signifies that the burden won’t come back because it has been carried away, or transformed, by something elemental and powerful. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=949))

---

> The IFS process is actually quite efficient and penetrating, but, paradoxically, it does this by being careful and respectful of protectors, not through strong-arm tactics. Furthermore, protectors are important in themselves. Since exiles are pushed into the background, it is the protectors that are out front relating to people and acting in the world. It isn’t enough to heal our exiles; our protectors must also be healed and transformed so they can drop their defensive roles, let their positive qualities emerge, and assume healthy roles in the inner system. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=997))

---

> The steps for getting to know a protector can be summarized as follows: In beginning a session, you access a number of protectors and then choose one to focus on, called the target part. You inhabit Self and get to know this protector, finding out its positive intent for you. You establish a trusting relationship with the protector and understand what it is trying to protect you from. This sets the stage for further work with the protector or for healing the exile it is protecting. ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1004))

Feels similar to focusing

> P5. “P” stands for protector. These steps constitute the content of Part I. P1: Accessing a part P2: Unblending from the target part P3: Unblending from a concerned part P4: Discovering a protector’s role P5: Developing a trusting relationship with a protector ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1008))

---

> Let’s suppose you have an issue you would like to work on. How do you know what parts to explore? In this section, we will show you how to determine which parts are involved with an issue. In IFS, issues are sometimes referred to as trailheads. A trailhead is an experience or a difficulty in your life that will lead to interesting parts if you follow it. It can be a situation or person that you react to, an emotional or bodily experience, a pattern of behavior or thinking, a dream, or anything else that indicates parts to explore. We call it a trailhead because it is the beginning of a trail that can lead to healing. It usually involves both a life situation and your response to that situation. ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1026))

---

> When you are at a trailhead, there is at least one part activated and often more than one. For example, when I am in a large group of strangers, I have at least three parts activated—one that is scared of being hurt, another part that wants to withdraw to protect me, and a third part that wants to reach out and talk to people despite the fear. ([Location 1046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1046))

identify with this

---

> You are likely to have at least one emotional reaction to the trailhead situation, perhaps more than one. You may feel angry, sad, or afraid, for example. In addition, you may notice certain attitudes you have in that situation; you may feel judgmental, thoughtless, stingy, careful, zany, doubtful, or mischievous. Each feeling, emotion, or attitude indicates the presence of a part, except for those attitudes that come from the Self, such as being kind or centered. Furthermore, if you feel cut off from your feelings, that is probably caused by a part. For example, if you feel dead, closed, or cold in a trailhead situation, there probably is a part causing this. ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1053))

---

> Most body sensations that come up in response to a trailhead are related to parts. The exceptions are purely physiological sensations (like a stomachache because of something you ate) and the bodily experiences of Self, such as feeling peaceful, open, or energetic. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1058))

---

> Many thoughts that arise in response to a trailhead situation come from parts. ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1063))

---

> An action or pattern of behavior can indicate a part—for example, withdrawing or becoming pushy. The avoidance of behavior also indicates a part. ([Location 1068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1068))

---

> Certain types of desires come from a part. One part may want closeness or success. Another might want to be seen and appreciated. A third might want to be left alone. ([Location 1070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1070))

---

> Let’s look at a more detailed example of a trailhead. When Betty visited her grown son’s house, she felt that he was being verbally abusive to his son, and she was considering talking to him about this but kept hesitating. ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1072))

> Choose a trailhead that you are interested in exploring. Using the approach described above, make a list of each of the parts involved with that trailhead. For each part, write the following if you can: Name of part What it feels emotionally What it looks like What it feels like in your body and where What it says How it makes you behave What it wants ([Location 1091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1091))

> At any given moment, a trailhead may or may not be activated, just like a part. If it is activated, you will feel your reaction to it. When you want to explore a trailhead that isn’t activated at the moment, imagine a recent time when that trailhead was active and notice how you feel inside. Or notice how you usually feel when that trailhead is activated. Then you can access all the parts related to it. ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1235))

---

> For each part, write down what you experience: Name of part What it feels emotionally What it looks like What it feels like in your body and where What it says ([Location 1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1260))

---

> At the beginning of an IFS session, you may want to discuss an issue in your life or talk about some parts you are aware of. Pretty soon, however, this purely intellectual understanding ceases to be of much value. It is time to go inside and explore yourself experientially. Your goal will be to focus on one part to get to know in some depth (as you will learn how to do over the rest of the book). This is called the target part. You have three options for going about this: Start with a part you already know about and access it. Access all the parts activated at the current moment and then choose one to focus on. Start with a trailhead. Analyze it to see what parts are related to it and then choose one to access. Or access all the parts related to the trailhead experientially and then choose one. Once you start working with a part, others may get activated that you must deal with. Sometimes you will continue to work with the original target part, and sometimes you will change your focus to one of them. ([Location 1265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1265))

---

> At any point in the day when you notice that a part is activated, you can briefly access it and pay attention to how it is affecting you. This gives you information about how often it is triggered, under what circumstances, and how it affects your emotions, your behavior, and your life. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1282))

---

> At the end of each day, take a few minutes to review the day for moments when the part was activated. Add to your notes at this time. This daily review will also help you to keep this exercise in mind the next day. Notes to take each time it happens: Situation How you experience the part What about this situation triggered the part ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1298))

---

> We can explain this in another way using the concept of the seat of consciousness. We each have a place in our psyche that determines our identity, choices, feelings, and perceptions. This seat can be occupied by Self or by a part. Whoever resides in the seat of consciousness at any given moment is in charge of our psyche at that time. Whether it is a part or the Self, the occupant of the seat determines how we feel, what our intentions are, how we perceive other people, how we relate to them, and what our choices and actions will be. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1322))

this is an interesting mental model, and sure it does counter somewhat with buddhism - but on another level it can be considered in alignment with buddhism, especially with burbea’s idea of “ways of seeing”
more i think about it the more it seems correct in some fundamental way. the Self is different than no-self in buddhism, but in another way it’s a capitalized Self and makes sense, and is omnipresent - a deeper consciousness, we’re not trying to eradicate selfhood, are we? just ego and trappings of considering solid self - but actually considering this fluid and being able to step back to a Self - very beautiful

---

> The Self is the natural occupant of the seat of consciousness because it is who we truly are. It is our essential nature, our spiritual center. This means that the Self occupies the seat of consciousness unless a part (such as Sheila’s Temper Tantrum Part) takes over the seat and pushes the Self into the background. Then that part is in charge of your psyche for a while. This can happen in an instant and usually without our realizing it.

> This example shows the two most common ways we relate to our difficult parts—either we are blended with them or we judge them. However, neither attitude is helpful in getting to know a part and connecting with it. To do that successfully, you must be centered in Self so you can relate to the part with curiosity and compassion.

---

> However, if we treat them like little beings inside of us who have our best interests at heart, we become open to a brand new way of relating to our feelings. We can get to know them, understand what drives them, and actually befriend them. When this happens, these parts will change, so they don’t have to overeat or flip out in rage anymore. They can relax and act sensibly. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=195))

---

> The human mind isn’t a unitary thing that sometimes has irrational feelings. It is a complex system of interacting parts, each with a mind of its own. It’s like an internal family--with wounded children, impulsive teenagers, rigid adults, hypercritical parents, caring friends, nurturing relatives, and so on. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=206))

---

> Underlying this cast of characters, every human being has a true Self that is wise, deep, open, and loving. This is who we truly are when we aren’t being hijacked by painful or defensive voices. The Self is the key to healing and integrating our disparate parts through its compassion, curiosity, and connectedness. It is also the natural leader of our inner family, a guide through the adventures of life. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=290))

---

> Because over the years we have experienced hurts, trauma, and grief, which have burdened us with shame, fear, and negative beliefs. These events have prompted some of our inner characters to take over in a desperate bid to protect us from harm. They blot out our pain, and, in the process, the light of the Self gets dimmed or lost. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=294))

---

> Experience with IFS shows that every part has a positive intent for you. It may want to protect you from harm or help you feel good about yourself. It may want to keep you from feeling pain or make other people like you. Every part of you is trying to help you feel good and avoid pain. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=306))

---

> You can’t get rid of a part of your psyche. You can only push it into the unconscious, where it will continue to affect you without your awareness. In IFS, we do something altogether different and radical. We welcome all our parts with curiosity and compassion. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=334))

---

> Chapter 2 Your Internal System Summary of the IFS Model This chapter introduces you to the IFS model, developed by psychologist Richard Schwartz, and gives a quick overview of how it works. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=440))

---

> Parts are entities of their own, with their own feelings, beliefs, motivations, and memories. It is especially important to understand that parts have motivations for everything they do. Nothing is just done out of habit. Nothing is just a pattern of thinking or behavior you learned. Everything (except for purely physiological reactions) is done by a part for a reason, even though that reason may be unconscious. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=450))

---

> Understanding the psyche in this way gives you a great deal of power to change your inner world for the better. Since parts are like little people inside you, you can make contact with them, get to know them, negotiate with them, encourage them to trust you, help them communicate with each other, and give them what they need to heal. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=454))

---

> Many parts perform roles that are healthy and functional. They make sure your life works well. They may help you connect with people or get work done. They may help you assert yourself or comprehend the world. Many parts have positive qualities that enhance your inner experience and external life, and allow you to cope with difficulties that come your way. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=476))

---

> Other parts, however, have taken on more extreme roles in a desperate attempt to protect you from pain, vulnerability, or harm. In IFS, an extreme role amounts to any action, feeling or thought that is dysfunctional. Quite simply, a part playing an extreme role causes problems in your life; it hampers it at best and cripples it at worst. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=479))

---

> There are two kinds of extreme parts—protectors and exiles. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=491))

---

> The job of protectors[1] is to protect you from feeling pain. They try to arrange your life and your psyche so that you are always in a kind of comfort zone and you never feel hurt, shame, or fear. They attempt to protect you from hurtful incidents or distressing relationships in your current life that could bring up buried pain from childhood. Since this can be intense, protectors are keen on preventing it from being activated. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=492))

---

> Protectors don’t realize that you aren’t a child anymore. They don’t realize that you have many more strengths and resources now, and you usually aren’t in danger as you were in the past. They try to avoid any situation that is similar to what you experienced as a child. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=500))

---

> In standard psychological language, these protectors are called “defenses.” ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=505))

---

> Exercise: Learning about Protectors Think about two of your protectors. For each one, write out answers to the following questions: What is its role in helping you manage your life and interact with the world? How does it relate to other people? How does it protect you from pain? What is its positive intent for you? What is it trying to protect you from? ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=531))

---

> Exiles are young child parts that are in pain from the past. While protectors try to keep us from feeling pain, exiles are the parts in pain. They are the ones the protectors are trying to protect us from. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=538))

---

> Exiles are often stuck at a particular time in childhood, at a specific age. They are literally two years old, or five or seven, and they exist in a situation from that time in your life. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=540))

---

> If your family life was chaotic, you will probably have an exile that feels jumbled inside. If your family treated each other with cold silence most of the time, you may have an ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=553))

---

> In addition to painful emotions, exiles have negative beliefs about you and about the world. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=561))

---

> Because exiles hold pain from your past, they are pushed away by protectors. They are exiled from your inner life and kept in dark dungeons away from the light of consciousness. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=565))

---

> An exile is usually caught in its own little world and is unaware that you have grown up and developed the capacity to take care of yourself, make friends, be independent, and perhaps start your own family. All it is aware of is a certain painful situation from your early life. Whenever something happens in the present that is similar, it reactivates that pain, which comes bubbling up toward the surface. Then your protectors go into high gear to prevent you from having to feel ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=566))

---

> Exercise: Learning about Exiles Think about two of your exiles. For each one, please write out the answers to the following questions: What emotions does it feel? What pain does it carry? What is it afraid of? What negative beliefs does it have? What situation or relationship is it stuck in from childhood? What current situations tend to trigger it? What protectors come up when that happens? ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=593))

---

> We all have a core part of us that is our true self, our spiritual center. When our extreme parts are not activated and in the way, this is who we are. The Self is relaxed, open, and accepting of yourself and others. When you are in Self, you are grounded, centered, and non-reactive. You don’t get triggered by what people do. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=611))

---

> Let’s look at four qualities of the Self that are particularly important for psychological healing. When you are in Self, you will naturally embody these qualities. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=628))

---

> The Self is connected. When you are in Self, you naturally feel close to other people and want to relate in harmonious, supportive ways. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=629))

---

> The Self also wants to be connected to your parts. When you are in Self, you are interested in having a relationship with each of your parts, which helps them to trust you, opening the way for healing. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=631))

---

> The Self is curious. When you are in Self, you are curious about other people in an open, accepting way. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=632))

---

> The Self is compassionate. Compassion is a form of kindness and love that arises when people are in pain. You genuinely care about how they feel and want to support them through difficult times. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=637))

---

> The Self is calm, centered, and grounded. This is especially helpful when you are relating to a part that has intense emotions. Intense grief or shame, for example, can be overwhelming if you aren’t grounded in Self, and protectors will avoid a part that has emotions like this at all costs. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=642))

---

> There are two goals for IFS therapy: one, heal your parts so that their extreme roles are converted to healthy roles, and two, help them to cooperate with each other under the leadership of the Self. ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=666))

---

> Parts aren’t defined by the negative beliefs and emotions they took on in childhood, which IFS calls their burdens. They have their own potential that is intrinsic to them. That is why they can let go of a burden and take on a new role in the psyche. ([Location 940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=940))

---

> IFS has discovered that it is helpful to release a burden to one of the basic elements in nature—earth, fire, wind, water, or light. This signifies that the burden won’t come back because it has been carried away, or transformed, by something elemental and powerful. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=949))

---

> The IFS process is actually quite efficient and penetrating, but, paradoxically, it does this by being careful and respectful of protectors, not through strong-arm tactics. Furthermore, protectors are important in themselves. Since exiles are pushed into the background, it is the protectors that are out front relating to people and acting in the world. It isn’t enough to heal our exiles; our protectors must also be healed and transformed so they can drop their defensive roles, let their positive qualities emerge, and assume healthy roles in the inner system. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=997))

---

> The steps for getting to know a protector can be summarized as follows: In beginning a session, you access a number of protectors and then choose one to focus on, called the target part. You inhabit Self and get to know this protector, finding out its positive intent for you. You establish a trusting relationship with the protector and understand what it is trying to protect you from. This sets the stage for further work with the protector or for healing the exile it is protecting. ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1004))

---

> Let’s suppose you have an issue you would like to work on. How do you know what parts to explore? In this section, we will show you how to determine which parts are involved with an issue. In IFS, issues are sometimes referred to as trailheads. A trailhead is an experience or a difficulty in your life that will lead to interesting parts if you follow it. It can be a situation or person that you react to, an emotional or bodily experience, a pattern of behavior or thinking, a dream, or anything else that indicates parts to explore. We call it a trailhead because it is the beginning of a trail that can lead to healing. It usually involves both a life situation and your response to that situation. ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1026))

---

> When you are at a trailhead, there is at least one part activated and often more than one. For example, when I am in a large group of strangers, I have at least three parts activated—one that is scared of being hurt, another part that wants to withdraw to protect me, and a third part that wants to reach out and talk to people despite the fear. ([Location 1046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1046))

identify with this

---

> You are likely to have at least one emotional reaction to the trailhead situation, perhaps more than one. You may feel angry, sad, or afraid, for example. In addition, you may notice certain attitudes you have in that situation; you may feel judgmental, thoughtless, stingy, careful, zany, doubtful, or mischievous. Each feeling, emotion, or attitude indicates the presence of a part, except for those attitudes that come from the Self, such as being kind or centered. Furthermore, if you feel cut off from your feelings, that is probably caused by a part. For example, if you feel dead, closed, or cold in a trailhead situation, there probably is a part causing this. ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1053))

---

> Most body sensations that come up in response to a trailhead are related to parts. The exceptions are purely physiological sensations (like a stomachache because of something you ate) and the bodily experiences of Self, such as feeling peaceful, open, or energetic. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1058))

---

> Many thoughts that arise in response to a trailhead situation come from parts. ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1063))

---

> An action or pattern of behavior can indicate a part—for example, withdrawing or becoming pushy. The avoidance of behavior also indicates a part. ([Location 1068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1068))

---

> Certain types of desires come from a part. One part may want closeness or success. Another might want to be seen and appreciated. A third might want to be left alone. ([Location 1070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1070))

---

> Let’s look at a more detailed example of a trailhead. When Betty visited her grown son’s house, she felt that he was being verbally abusive to his son, and she was considering talking to him about this but kept hesitating.

Or notice how you usually feel when that trailhead is activated. Then you can access all the parts related to it.

> For each part, write down what you experience: Name of part What it feels emotionally What it looks like What it feels like in your body and where What it says ([Location 1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1260))

> At the beginning of an IFS session, you may want to discuss an issue in your life or talk about some parts you are aware of. Pretty soon, however, this purely intellectual understanding ceases to be of much value. It is time to go inside and explore yourself experientially. Your goal will be to focus on one part to get to know in some depth (as you will learn how to do over the rest of the book). This is called the target part. You have three options for going about this: Start with a part you already know about and access it. Access all the parts activated at the current moment and then choose one to focus on. Start with a trailhead. Analyze it to see what parts are related to it and then choose one to access. Or access all the parts related to the trailhead experientially and then choose one. Once you start working with a part, others may get activated that you must deal with. Sometimes you will continue to work with the original target part, and sometimes you will change your focus to one of them.

> At any point in the day when you notice that a part is activated, you can briefly access it and pay attention to how it is affecting you. This gives you information about how often it is triggered, under what circumstances, and how it affects your emotions, your behavior, and your life.

> At the end of each day, take a few minutes to review the day for moments when the part was activated. Add to your notes at this time. This daily review will also help you to keep this exercise in mind the next day. Notes to take each time it happens: Situation How you experience the part What about this situation triggered the part ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00452V8EG&location=1298))

> We can explain this in another way using the concept of the seat of consciousness. We each have a place in our psyche that determines our identity, choices, feelings, and perceptions. This seat can be occupied by Self or by a part. Whoever resides in the seat of consciousness at any given moment is in charge of our psyche at that time. Whether it is a part or the Self, the occupant of the seat determines how we feel, what our intentions are, how we perceive other people, how we relate to them, and what our choices and actions will be.

this is an interesting mental model, and sure it does counter somewhat with buddhism - but on another level it can be considered in alignment with buddhism, especially with burbea’s idea of “ways of seeing”
more i think about it the more it seems correct in some fundamental way. the Self is different than no-self in buddhism, but in another way it’s a capitalized Self and makes sense, and is omnipresent - a deeper consciousness, we’re not trying to eradicate selfhood, are we? just ego and trappings of considering solid self - but actually considering this fluid and being able to step back to a Self - very beautiful

> The Self is the natural occupant of the seat of consciousness because it is who we truly are. It is our essential nature, our spiritual center. This means that the Self occupies the seat of consciousness unless a part (such as Sheila’s Temper Tantrum Part) takes over the seat and pushes the Self into the background. Then that part is in charge of your psyche for a while. This can happen in an instant and usually without our realizing it.

> This example shows the two most common ways we relate to our difficult parts—either we are blended with them or we judge them. However, neither attitude is helpful in getting to know a part and connecting with it. To do that successfully, you must be centered in Self so you can relate to the part with curiosity and compassion.
