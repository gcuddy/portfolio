# Reading on the web is underrated, but doesn't beat print 20220105115209

In many ways, reading on the web has gotten a bed reputation. And perhaps for good reason: websites are often a minefield of ads, popups, and poor design.

But there is *so much* that can be done with web design, and still so much untapped potential, even all these years later. This makes me actually think that reading online is *underrated*. I don't think it's a great trend for the web to abstract our reading away to a "clutter-free" reading app like Instapaper, although I understand the impulse. The web — in all its glorious funkiness, shining individuality — can be a place to read.

vs printing, which i  the next best thing..

I don't like abstracting my reading away to another app now.

Earlier I thought that [[The format of reading emails is not conducive to deep information 20201125183600]], and that's probably still true, but I'm not convinced pushing it to an RSS reader or elsewhere is the answer... feel like email is just as good a place as any, but nothing beats print. E-ink hardware/software is not at the place it needs to be to make a difference.
