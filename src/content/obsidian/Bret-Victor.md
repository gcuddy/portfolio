response to julie bodian about elevator pitch:

yes! He’s a popular programming philosopher/futurist(?)/communicator of ideas of sorts thinking about interface and interaction design, media theory, and tools for thought. Several of his essays/talks have become somewhat canonical at least among certain groups. His ideas about computing have influenced me a lot in thinking about what computers are (where they come from and what they could do) beyond the rectangular square limitations that we currently (largely) have. For the last for years he’s been doing a research project called Dynamicland that tries to reimagine computing through physical objects that is cool (though has largely been quiet)
