# "What year is this?"

The final words spoken of [[Twin Peaks: The Return]], and words that I keep returning back to, that seem exceedingly relevant in [[2020]]. As we come into a paralyzed state of confusion. Where even are we? What year is this? What's happening?

It all comes bubbling back up. The unknown. The unspeakable. The deep recesses of the unconscious. Confusion; trauma.

And then: the lights go out.

Of course, *The Return* doesn't quite end there.

The credits are superimposed over one last image: Laura whispering to Cooper an unknowable secret, the image soft and receding.
