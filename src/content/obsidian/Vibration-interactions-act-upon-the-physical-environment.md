Vibrations are one of the few physical interactions we have, that may in effect “act upon” the physical environment. When a phone vibrates in your hand it has a strong tactile sensation. When it is on a table and vibrates, it shakes the table a bit and moves itself around.

Are there any other interactions that are like this? Loud sound with a strong bass (like from a good car stereo; thinking of loud cars driving by in Crown Heights) is probably the closest, but feels very different. And then obviously there’s Smart Home stuff but that also feels different.

This type of interaction also leaves us with an interesting chasm between our selves and digital selves: we’ve almost all had the experience of “phantom vibrations”, when we think our phone vibrates in our pocket but it didn’t.
