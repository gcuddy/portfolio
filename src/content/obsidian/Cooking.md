Things I'd like - Salt cellar and (maybe) a pepper mill?

[[Grocery Stores in New York]]
# Cooking Staples

## Seasonings

- Seasoning salt - Diamond Crystal
- Finishing salt - Jacobsen Salt Co. is popular, so is Maldon
- Black Pepper
	- [Tellicherry Black peppercorns from Reluctant Trading](https://reluctanttrading.com/products/tellicherry-black-peppercorns-divakars-no-004) - McFadden recommends, many chefs use. Seems like a fair price.
	- [[pepper mill]] - fletcher's mill, you want a coarse grind
	- “Keep peppercorns in an airtight glass container, like a mason jar, so you can pour them quickly from the jar into the mill.”
- Spices and Herbs
	- Whole - grind in mortar pestle
	- Whole coriander seeds and Fennel seeds (Mcfadden, six seasons) and Cumin
	- Store in glass jars
	- Dried: bay leaf and oregano are worth having around
	- Toast whole spices first gently in a dry pan to maximize flavor, then crush in mortar and pestle
	- You should "overhaul" your spice cabinet at least noce a year

## Oils and Vinegar

- Nice [[olive oil]]
	- Cook with modestly priced ones and save the expensive ones for dressing/finishing

## Pantry

### Dried Beans

- Chickpeas (garbanzos)

- Store cooked beans in liquid in fridge after cooling
- Store dried beans in airtight container in cool, dry place

### Bulk

- Nuts
	- Roasted/salted are good for snacking
	- For cooking, buy them raw and toast them yourself
	- Nuts easily go rancid and freshness is critical — buy them from a busy market with high turnover
	- Walnuts/pecan halves over pieces
	- Hazelnuts
	- Pistachios
	- Toasting nuts at 325 F, stirring occasionally, keep eye on them
- Dried Fruit
	- Apricot, figs, dates, raisins, dried cherries, dried cranberries

### Canned and Bottled

- Canned Tomatoes
	- Stanislaus (restaurant grade), Muir Glen Organic (for long-cooked dishes), Biano DiNapoli (quickj pizza and pasta dishes)
	- Lasts along time
	- No herbs, just pure tomato
- Tomato Paste
	- Rich & concentrated w/o liquid
	- Carmelize first — adding to hot pan with olive oil, letting it sizzle and darken and stick to pan. Then deglaze with water, wine, or stock
- Preserved fish
	- Anchovies, Sardines, Tuna
	- Brands:
		- Spanish:
			- Jose Gourmet
			- Ortiz - great anchovies
			- Matiz - great sardines
		- Wild Planet and American Tuna
			- Look for albacore tuna
	- Anchovies are flavor powerhouse
		- Fishiness disappears in sauce leaving their umami
	- Oil-packed fillets are easiest to use, just blot dry before use
- Fish Sauce
	- Red Boat is great brand, so is Three Crabs
	- Unopened will last a few years, opened should store in fridge and used within one year
- Pickles, Olives, Capers
	- Pickles
		- You can make your own and you should
		- McFadden also likes kosher dills from Sonoma Brinery, spicy pickled green beans form Rick's Picks, pickled curried cauliflower from McVicker pickles
	- Olives
		- Supermarket olive bar is great
		- Kinds of olives to get
			- Castelvetrano — Sicilian green olives, meaty and buttery, great for snacking

			- Taggiasca — Liguria olives, simlar to Nicoise, dense, delicious, balanced
			- Kalamata — classic from Greece, meaty, smoky, fruity
		- Last a long time in fridge
	- Capers
		- Salt-packed capers are good over brined, but require soaking to remove excess salt
- Chiles: dried, pickled, preserved
	- Chiles de arbol are most vesatile — hot but not fiery, pair with everything
	- Red Chile flakes
		- if going in cooked dish, bloom in warm oil at start of cooking to bring out their flavor/soften them
		- for cold dishes just sprinkle them on
	- Pickled chiles like pepperoncini are great in salads and salads, so are oil-packed Calabrian chiles

### Cheese

- Use cheese as seasoning: to balance salt, boost umami, add rich/fatty flavor
- Find a great cheese shop and make friends with people behind counter

	- SarVecchio Parmesan
		- Wisconsin-made, close in flavor to Italian version (but less expensive)
	- Pecorino Romano
		- Less sweet than parmigiano, with saltier/tangier punch

		- At least a year old
		- Pleasantly sharp tang slightly crumbly

- Fresh Cheese
	- At their best shortly after they're made, plan on using them day that you buy them, and store in their original containers in their liquiid

		- Can drain in paper coffee filter or colander with cheesecloth to concentrate flavor
	- Burrata
