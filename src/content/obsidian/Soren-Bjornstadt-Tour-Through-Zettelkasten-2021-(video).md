Noticed that he uses (in new zettelkasten ) an `es` field to indiicate epistemtic status (confident, likely, etc) (n:: [[epistemic status]])

Tags as Types
Yellow tags - Provide:
- needsAttention (corresponds to note/tidy and note/develop)
	- more attention/change things, unspecified problem, reworked/revisited
- needsExcision (note/refactor)
	- monster card and contains too much, needs to be broken down
- stub (note/boat -> needs to be expanded)
	- expand articles

Three links: https://youtu.be/GjpjE5pMZMI?t=3971
- Link to more general idea, link to more specific idea, a related topic ("lateral" idea)
	- up/down/x - compare with syncretizm [[ontologies (schemas) in pkm]] 
	- Can even do a missing link
- Handy heuristic
- Not always possible, but handy and useful more often than you'd think. Great to help you to actually link.

## Notes from perusing his Zettelkasten

On `stub` tag:
Things don't have to be tagged with  just because they're short. We don't want to go OverEngineering things, because many tiddlers may be dead-ends. If they aren't dead-ends, then we'll end up seeing them again and can improve on them if appropriate. Things should be tagged Stub if we believe the material is inadequate for even the present moment and the only limitation to expanding it is time.
