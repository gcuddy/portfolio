[[web2]]

Content is skeumorphically downsized to fit into aka a singular box or React component

contrast with personal website

See:
Robin Sloan has talked about this

Also discussed on Metamuse 39 with [[Weiwei Xu]] I think around the ~50 minute mark

[[Kicks Condor]] also on about this - them and Weiwei talk about everything having ssame gray color and blue

Part of what Weiwei is trying to do with Sprout
