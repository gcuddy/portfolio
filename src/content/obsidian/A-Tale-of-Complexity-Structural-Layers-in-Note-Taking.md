Structure notes should emerge in a Zettelkasten system organically

When a cluster of notes becomes too dense to navigate easily, use structure notes to provide maps

Structure notes emerge in a Zettelkasten-like system organically.

> ==But after a while, you won’t be able to keep up==. When I search for tags I get a couple hundred of notes. I have to review them to connect a note to some of them, or get a grasp of what I wrote and thought about a specific topic.
> ...
> I introduced hub-like notes when I had between 500 and 700 notes.

This is like davecan's fps metaphor - ![[davecan on MOCs#^9ce025]]

> My archive became opaque like the sea: You can see a couple inches into the deep but you know there is much more that you can’t access. You can dive deep, but still you just see a couple of inches at any time. Therefore, I thought of it in terms of unexplored territory for which I need mapping methods and such.

Structure notes look like tables of contents:

> They look much like a table of contents. It’s because they _are_ tables of contents. A table of contents is a structured set of chapters of a book, a set with hierarchy and order. Of course, a book’s page sequence is ordered according to the table of contents for the reader’s convenience. A structure note doesn’t need to adhere to any didactic needs or any needs other than yours.

Similarity to tags? davecan has pointed this out as well...

> Structure notes share a similarity to tags: Both point to sets of notes. Structure notes just add another element. They are sets with _added structure_. This added structure provides a better overview and adds to the utility of the archive.

At the top is structure notes that structure structure notes (MOC?):

> After a while, I did not only have structure notes that structure content notes, I also had structure notes that mainly structured sets of structure notes. They became my top level structure notes because they began to float on the top of my archive, so to say.

Knowledge is emergent:

> There are emergent structures that underly every self-organizing body of knowledge. Software that helps you deal with these structures needs to fulfill a couple of criteria for its ability to handle complex structures. One criterion is: Does the software provide access to those different structural layers? If it doesn’t offer the means to deal with those structures, it won’t help you in your work once your archive becomes more complex.

Interesting idea contra projects/folders, but I'm not sure it's entirely valid:

> ==If a system encapsulates single projects or topics, chances are that it can’t cope with complexity==. This is okay if you want to just work on one project. But if you want to use a system as an aid to writing and as a thinking tool you should ==opt for a system that is powerful enough for a lifetime of thoughts==. So, watch out for folders and projects. They are the means for dealing with encapsulating and limiting complexity. In addition, they hinder the most productive way of knowledge production: the interdisciplinary part.
