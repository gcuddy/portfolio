With the rise of extremely strong artificial intelligence like [[GPT-3]] and CLIP+VQGAN, the lines between individual creator and art are blurred.

The former allows for creation of eerily strong text-based products; a creative "poet" who works with GPT-3 might feed it in a few lines of a T.S. Eliot poem and get back something odd and interesting,  a bit uncanny — and yes, a bit soulless, but not as much as you might think. [Here's @tambourine's process](https://alwaysalready.dreamwidth.org/5200.html), what she describes as "neural net poetry". She uses the computer as a sort of writing partner, bouncing ideas and phrases off of it, gently reworking what it spits back. She ends up with some text that she'll cut and rework some more, pruning it of clichés and oddities:

```
saying grace after every bowl
of soup. i have heard
of weddings now, heard
sweet souls said goodbye to one
another in song as the winter
rot set in and blossoms fell.
now, almost in full leaf
the agapanthus bursts through the door,
sending up their lacy, winged blossoms,
light as feathers, but everywhere
an abiding darkness is beating
and words that make me cry:
—and now, with aching beauty,
let us sing:
sing it out for those left behind
if they are part of you—
```

Some really lovely lines in there!

In a way this way of "embedding" the computer with the art is reminiscent of the entire school of [[tools for thought]] — I guess it's more a fledging school of Tools for Art?

## AI Art

CLIP+VQGAN allows for computer-generated artwork that often leads to incredibly rich results — [especially when given an artist byline](https://www.aiweirdness.com/my-favorite-nonexistent-painter/), as Janelle Shane from AI Weirdness notes. (e.g. Internet Infrastructure by James Gurney, pictured below).

What's going on here? This art is genuinely interesting to look at; it hurts my brain (and soul?) to think that a heartless computer created it.

Take a gander through [Ryan Moulton's "Tour of the Sacred Library"](https://moultano.wordpress.com/2021/07/20/tour-of-the-sacred-library/), where he invites us for a walk through a library — a series of AI-generated images from the text "~room name~ in the sacred library by James Gurney" — coupled with very inviting writing through the dream/liminal/latent space.
