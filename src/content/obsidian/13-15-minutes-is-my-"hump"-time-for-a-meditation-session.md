#on/meditation 
up:: [[meditation]]

Something I've noticed is that, especially when I'm feeling reluctant to meditate, I will reach a real sticking point in a sit about ~13 minutes in. (This is probably very variable based off how much I've been practicing recently.) To be fair, this sticking point is especially multiplied when I have had coffee/caffeine.

Around that time is when I'll start to feel like I need to get up, like I need the session to end, like I'm having lots of [[doubt]]. 

If I can push through this, however, and get to around ~20 minutes, I find that things get a lot smoother then!
