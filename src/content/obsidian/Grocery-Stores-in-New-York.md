this is probably a silly note, but anyway:

## Chinatown

- Extremely cheap, fresh produce from street vendors
- Hong Kong supermarket - huge, popular store
- Deluxe Meat Market - top butcher and grocery store, Eric Sze from 886 shops there - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5xjobO_kts&t=95s
- Wing Heung Noodle on Baxter Street - Sze gets fresh noodles from there, not sure if it's for non-restaurants tho
- 
## Bed Stuy/Crown Heights

- Alive Herbals - good spice store and olive oils

## Brighton Beach

- Incredible selection of Sour Cream and affordable caviar

## Farmers Markets

- Saturday Green market at prospect park, for specialty and seasonal produce
