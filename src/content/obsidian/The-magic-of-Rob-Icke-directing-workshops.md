For the last year (!), British directors Lyndsey Turner and Robert Icke have been running one of the most impressive theater masterclasses I've ever been a part of. Every Monday, for two hours, they held a Directing session; effectively, it was a full-on university course. In the beginning Icke and Turner covered their rehearsal process, and walked through how they would go about working on a play. But as the weeks went on, a rotating slate of guests came in. By the end, it seemed like I would check the email for the week and would see every major director coming in for a couple hours. (The last few weeks had both Rachel Chavkin and Ivo Van Hove, among others. (Lol to being on a Zoom with Ivo with 200 other people.))

To me, this is one of the greatest things to come out of the pandemic for theater. Not necessarily streaming theater — that's a mixed bag for me, though there are obvious accessibility wins and fascinating formal complexities — but the normally inaccessible stuff to complement theater.

While the [accessibility of streaming theater](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/06/magazine/drama-streaming.html) has been rightfully well-documented, equally important is the accessibility of great discourse and training. Much of the trouble with theater — and other arts — is the absurdly exclusive and class-driven culture of theater training at universities. Those that can afford to send their kid to acting/art school, for instance, tend to be already of a certain class — driving a vicious cycle in the fossilization of theater. Introducing more free, online, world-class training like this is a huge win for theater. It makes the scarce abundant in a different way. ^9f292a

Of course, these workshops had their own artificial scarcity implemented on them. While anyone could join, from anywhere in the world, they still weren't recorded — even when they could have been on Zoom. This was by design, to be clear — and it's a choice that makes some sense — but it still was enforced scarcity. They also weren't advertised widely, and there was an implicit agreement made to not post about what happened in the sessions on Social Media. There's always trade-offs in the spectrum of scarcity/abundance in anything digital, as we're learning; the positive effect of these constraints is that it helps the sessions feel more important, and gives much more weight to being present. But it also meant that, when I had work at the same time, I couldn't attend. It's a balance worth exploring.
