contra:: [[What do we mean when we say innovation? ↯]]

#2022/10/30 interesting that Wang uses the capitalistic terms "definite optimism" (after Thiel in [[Zero to One by Peter Thiel]]), talking in negation of dystopias, but sort of ignores the world of [[utopian sci-fi]] which, ala [[Ursula Le Guin]], is rather socialistic/anarchistic (contra:: [[§ Leftism]]).
This is maybe partially buecause Wang is more interested in the classically mascluine "hard" sci-fi (see Le Guin on this as well: [[Ursula K. Le Guin A Rant About Technology]]) (read: be careful about use of "technology" and equating that with "high-tech")

## Highlights
- In a brief essay, Anton Howes asks: “Is innovation in human nature?” That is to say, do people have some natural stock of innovative capacity, waiting to burst forth when conditions are right? By way of anecdote, Howes’ answer is: not really. He pushes back against the idea that the industrial revolution took place merely because the economic conditions were suitable for one: “The more I study the lives of British innovators, the more convinced I am that innovation is not in human nature… People innovate because they are inspired to do so. And when people do not innovate, it is often simply because it never occurs to them to do so. Incentives matter too, of course. But a person needs to at least have the idea of innovation—an improving mentality—before they can choose to innovate.”
- I’ve come to the view that creativity and innovative capacity aren’t a fixed stock, coiled and waiting to be released by policy
- I ==wonder if economists overrate the easier-to-observe policy factors and under-theorize the idea that **positive visions of the future drive long-term growth**==
- To put it in a different way, I wish that they would consider definite optimism as human capital. In addition to education levels, human capital models should consider factors like optimism, imagination, and hope for the future.
- To have a positive vision, people must first expand their imaginations. And I submit that ==an **interest in science fiction, the material world, and proximity to industry all help to refine that optimism**==. I mean to promote imagination by direct injection.
- Let’s start with the capacity of science fiction to improve imagination. ==One way of having a better idea of the technological future is to first read about one in a book or see one on screen==.
- The dominant mode in modern sci-fi movies is dystopia, and perhaps even nihilism. Today, ==the **contrarian project is to present an earnest, joyful vision of the technological future**==.
- If I had funding and access to studio talent, I would reshoot a bunch of films. Elysium, with a focus on the logistics behind the smooth functioning of a satellite habitat. Ex Machina, featuring an artificial intelligence whose greatest desire is not acceptance in human society. Gravity, with greater marveling of space and the desire to explore, not the aftermath of random mechanical failure. Her, in which artificial intelligences decide to improve humanity, instead of migrating en masse to a higher spiritual plane. ==Star Wars with no wars and no Jedis—and therefore no Sith—that instead draws out the gains from interstellar exchange under oversight of the Trade Federation==. (Bonus points for working out rules that would govern countervailing duties and state procurement under a galactic trade regime.)
    - Note: LOL to the last one
- It is so conventional these days to watch yet another movie about how robots attempt to wipe out humanity, but ultimately fail, because they’re missing some essential soulful touch. So let me provide prompts to the enterprising screenwriter: ==What might society look like if we had energy too cheap to meter? If artificial intelligences must be otherworldly, how about we present them as angels of Rilke come down to Earth? When humanity manages to become a solar civilization, can we depict the inventions we need to colonize various moons and planets? How about the logistics of how colonies trade?==
- Books are less uniformly dystopian. I loved two that I read in the past year: *==**Seveneves* by Neal Stephenson and *The Three Body Problem* by Liu Cixin**==. ==Both present definite optimistic visions of the future==: Calamity threatens humanity; but it allows some time for humanity to prepare; and humanity uses this time to plan out the technological future.
- ==The fewer the manufacturing workers and engineers, the more removed everyone is from the particulars of industrial processes, and the more remote that knowledge becomes in each successive generation==. ==We become think tankers and app designers and restaurant hosts, while **the details of the industrial world become further and loftier abstractions**==. How many of our grandparents were familiar with the details of ball bearings, wire production, concrete mixing, industrial chemicals, while we are not?
- ==I regret this abstraction of the material world. Most of our living standards are tied to the world of atoms==. Even when we spend a lot of time online and on our phones, we go to work in cars and subways; keep ourselves warm and cool using machinery and electricity; surround ourselves with objects that let us cook or relax; and on and on. The online world is not entirely free of the material world.

- Manufacturing work tends to be hazardous or unpleasant in all sorts of ways. But it’s also associated with faster productivity growth and the ==greater possibility of technological upgrading==
- If a state has lost most of its jobs for electrical engineers, or nuclear engineers, or mechanical engineers, then fewer young people in that state will study those practices, and technological development in related fields slow down a little further
	- x:: [[China propaganda culture focuses on state-aligned goals that have industrial prowess, like making semiconductors 20220205175242]]
- According to BLS, the bulk of service jobs are in 1. government (22 million), 2. professional services (19mn), 3. healthcare (18mn), 4. retail (15mn), and 5. leisure and hospitality (15mn). In addition to being often low-paying but still competitive, ==a great deal of service sector jobs tend to stress capacity for emotional labor over capacity for manual labor. And it’s the latter that tends to be more present in fields involving technological upgrading.==
- How far along is humanity in its progress toward its bright technological future? I submit that ==we’re less than 3 percent of where we should ultimately be.== Let’s worry about premature deindustrialization in the developed world as well.
- There are plenty of service jobs that are meant to cancel out the efforts of other service jobs.
- I submit that an underrated Trump phenomenon is how many people have been drawn to care about political scandal. I haven’t much changed the people I follow on Twitter, but my feed has gone something like 25 percent politics to 60 percent politics; I don’t have a Facebook, and I suspect that something similar happens there as well. So many people have become addicted to retweeting the very latest Trump embarrassment, or making identical jokes about it.
	- x:: [[Mimetic Desire (Girard)]]
- This is the social risk: That the minds of many talented young people today will be permanently disfigured by this obsession with Trump embarrassments.
- ==Call me a romantic, but I’d like everyone to think more about industrial lubricants, gas turbines, thorium reactors, wire production, ball bearings, underwater cables, and all the things that power our material world.==
- First, we can all try to engage more actively with the material world, not merely the digital or natural world. ==Go ahead and **pick an industrial phenomenon and learn more about it**==.
	- mw:: I love [[The Prepared]] for this.
- Second, we should ==ask for more **direct, unironic celebrations of innovation in popular culture**== ^06f51b
	- contrast with:: [[What do we mean when we say innovation? ↯]]
	- q:: [[↯ Tension of Innovation - Is there a trade-off between innovation and collective care?]]
- Fewer op-eds on how people should feel about upcoming legislation; instead, ==more creation of cultural products that get people excited about the technological future==. These kinds of efforts to promote definite optimism, rather  than a continuous focus on never-ending political battles, might result in greater economic growth in the long run.
	- mw:: I do agree with this, though. I think. 2022-07-18
- When we get sucked into [[Mimetic Desire (Girard)|Girardian dynamics]], people get too competitive, always trying to one-up another in the group, until they reach places that look totally extreme to the outside world. ==The way to avoid this Girardian conflict is to direct our gaze outwards to the tangible things of the world==.
