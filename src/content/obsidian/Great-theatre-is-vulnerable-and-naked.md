## Great theatre is vulnerable and naked.

"The closer we move towards the true nakedness of theatre, the closer we approach a stage that has a lightness and range far beyond film or television." - Peter Brook

True vulnerability on stage is breathtaking and dangerous. Performing is a courageous act, because it involves risk.

Raw life, in all its natural tragedy, is spellbinding on stage. Vulnerability, warts, intricate sadness, embarrassment. We are seeing actual, real-life human beings struggle, in all their bizarre complexity.

Many productions set actors up to act with quotes around them, which causes a barrier to go up between us and them. They act “Anger”, “Sex” and “Power”, instead of Anger. Sex. Power. Great theatre takes off the mask. [^1]
