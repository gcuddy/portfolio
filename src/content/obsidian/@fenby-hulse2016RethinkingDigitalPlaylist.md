[[The mixtape was a means of asynchronous emotional communication 20220211233730]]

## mixtapes as romantic plot devices

"In addition, the mixtape has inspired a range of creative outputs. For instance, mixtapes and mixtape culture are used as a romantic plot device in the novel Nick and Norah ' Infi nite Playlist by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan (2006, fi lm version 2008) and in Stephen Chbosky's novel The Perks of Being a Wallfl ower (2009, fi lm version 2012). Similar references to the mixtape are also seen in fi lms such as the Hollywood blockbuster No Strings Attached (2011), the Saudi Arabian fi lm Wadjda (2012) and the Turkish fi lm Mix Tape (2014). While movies such as Without a Paddle (2004) and Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) also reference mixtape culture, the personalised mix takes on a slightly different narrative function." ([Fenby-Hulse 2016:173](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=3))

## mixtape as underpinning of music streaming services

"Perhaps most interesting, though, is the fact that the mixtape's aura has underpinned the development of music streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music. ==For instance, in an interview with The Times newspaper in 2010 Daniel Ek, co-founder of Spotify, made explicit that Spotify's digital playlists are 'the next generation of mixtapes'.== In 2015, the company's development and marketing strategy remains largely the same, although there now seems to be an increasing focus on auto-generated playlists. Following the announcement of its latest personalised playlist, product manager Matthew Ogle described Spotify's =='Discover Weekly' playlist as an attempt 'to make something that felt like your best friend making you a mixtape'== (Dredge 2015 )" ([Fenby-Hulse 2016:174](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=4))

_Ha - that's fascinating, because if that's the case they've both utterly failed. ==The "playlist" a marketer of culture has become a thing; but the algorithmic and/or inhuman quality of it are what's missing==. They're fascinatingly inert. ([note on p.174](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=4))_

Music ultimately becomes a means to an end:

"Spotify's mission is to transform the music listening experience through the development of auto-generated playlists, user recommendations and the employment of expert music curators to help users navigate an increasingly global library of music. The curation of content by both experts and users is crucial to Spotify's business model. As well as providing users with the ability to create personalised playlists, the Spotify platform also allows them to search through a whole range of playlists that have been curated by ==genre, mood and increasingly social function==. While the company explicitly acknowledges the mixtape and its history in its press releases, the listening experience that it offers is actually radically different from that of the mixtape and ==seems to revolve more around activity-based listening or functional music than enabling a shared listening and social experience==. For example, its featured playlists, which are curated by in-house 'music programmers', are aligned to the time of day and time of year, as well as to seasonal events and/or occasions. On Sunday morning, for example, the recommended playlists might include 'Sunday Morning Coffee' or 'Soulful Morning'. On a Friday evening, the playlists 'Club Dance Hits' or 'Totally Tropical House' are more likely to be featured." ([Fenby-Hulse 2016:180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=10))

_This alignment of music with function strips the emotional and soulful connection with the art form. It sees music as a productivity aide, rather than an art form in and of itself. ([note on p.180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=10))_

## mechanics of mixtapes

"Mixtapes required the creator to think about what songs to include, how they were to be ordered and what the cover art might look like to ensure that the message they sought to communicate was understood as intended by their friend or lover. In short, mixtapes were ==a means of aesthetic communication, the cassette (and its casing and inlay) a medium by which to tell a musical and visual story==." ([Fenby-Hulse 2016:175](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=5))

"To my mind, though, the mixtape is not simply an aidemémoire but an ==aesthetic object that is infused with musical and visual symbols== that encourage and inform a ==narrative reading== by the recipient-" ([Fenby-Hulse 2016:177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=7))

"While this move from analogue to digital may not seem that signifi cant, the fact that mix-CDs could be created by simply dragging and dropping fi les, rather than through a lengthy process of simultaneous real-time recording and listening, meant that ==the slower, craft-like process attributed to making mixtapes began to disappear==. The speed by which playlists could be created was complemented by the rapid development of peer-to-peer fi le sharing. File sharing provided Internet users with access to a diverse and global library of music." ([Fenby-Hulse 2016:178](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=8))

"Interestingly, though, and in contrast to the cassette-based mixtape, ==**the iPod encouraged a listening experience that was self-directed and primarily personal==**. The inherent **==social nature of the mixtape** had somehow got **lost in analogue-to-digital translation**==, something that is perhaps evident from Apple's early iPod commercials, where the silhouetted fi gures, each with headphones plugged in, dance to their **personal music collection**. The visual and aural detachment of the **silhouetted figures** emphasises the **private musical experience** that the iPod offered. For Michael Bull, the iPod revolutionised music listening through its portability and focus on personalised musical experiences. As he states, 'technologies such as iPods, mobile phones, and automobiles act as tools enabling the **urban** citizen to move through the chilly spaces of urban culture wrapped in **a cocoon of communicative warmth** whilst further contributing to the chill that surrounds them' (Bull 2007 p. 18)" ([Fenby-Hulse 2016:179](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=9)) ^a22e72

_Didn't this also happen earlier with the rise of the Sony [[Sony walkman]]? ([note on p.179](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=9))_ [[The Walkman marked the movement of music from external to internal 20220201220251]]



"The creator of the digital playlist also seems to reside further in the background, with Spotify users only able to provide a playlist title. It is currently not possible to give descriptions, write blurbs, or upload album art. This makes the playlist seemingly less tailored to the recipient and, as such, more open to interpretation, thus offering a stark contrast to the carefully planned and intense narrative trajectory of a mixtape." ([Fenby-Hulse 2016:180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=10))

_this is huge as well! the lack of aesthetic personalization is a major factor in their inhuman feeling. ([note on p.180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=10))_

"As Dominik Schrey has observed, 'nostalgia for seemingly obsolete modes of representation is a way of theorising changes in media' (Schrey 2014 p. 29)" ([Fenby-Hulse 2016:181](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=11))

"From a design perspective, the aesthetic, craft-like process that underpins the making of a mixtape is worthy of further consideration, as it offers a unique example of '[[emotionally durable design]]'. A term developed by design theorist Jonathan Chapman ( 2005 ), emotionally durable design offers a potential solution to hyper-consumerism and increasing waste. Arguing that 'emotionally durable design' has the potential to transport users beyond the ephemeral world of technocentric design, Chapman's research examines how ideas of **narrative, attachment, enchantment, surface and consciousness can be embedded into the design process to enable users to have longer-lasting and more signifi cant emotional connections with their purchases**. By connecting the memories and musical personality of both the creator and the receiver, the mixtape is an artifact filled with enchantment—a connection established almost immediately between object and user. The emotional attachment is heightened by the fact that the mixtape brings together an aural experience with a haptic and visual one. Indeed, the inlay, the tape and the casing all form part of the mixtape experience. Like the experience often attributed to vinyl records (Bartmanski and Woodward 2015 ), mixtapes are as much about looking, touching and sharing as they are about listening." ([Fenby-Hulse 2016:182](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=12))

_Fascinating - first I've heard of this idea. ([note on p.182](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=12))_

"The challenge that we face now is how to translate the haptic, material and sonic experience of the mixtape into the digital realm. Indeed, how can we use Web 2.0 technologies to enhance digital music platforms so that they go beyond a mere musical library or archive and enable new types of social engagement and creativity? In short, when developing digital environments, how do we ensure that we are thinking not only about storage and broadcast, but also about interaction and creativity?" ([Fenby-Hulse 2016:183](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=13))

"**Unlike the mixtape, which would fade and warp with time, acquiring marks, chips and stains reminiscent of experiences or occasions, a digital playlist is 'clean**'. Playlists can be edited, removed or deleted; there are **no digital traces of the playlist's past**. In a way, the playlist has **no history and no place**. I have no idea when playlists were created, whether and what alterations have been made (by myself or another user) and relatively little information on who created them or who has listened to them. There are no reminders as to where and when I first listened to that playlist, or who I shared that musical experience with. Digital music playlists, at present, appear to be **functional** in nature. They provide a simple and effective way of accessing musical content that is curated to suit a range of situations, whether that be the gym, a party or work. They are **rarely creative undertakings or acts of identity performance**." ([Fenby-Hulse 2016:183](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=13)) ^0066ec

_I've referred to this as "digital texture". [[§Bridging analog texture with digital world]] But it's the same idea here. ([note on p.183](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=13))_

"By looking at the mixtape and comparing it with the development of the digital playlist, I hope to have shown that the recent resurgence in mixtape culture need not be understood as a restorative, nostalgic turn to a bygone analogue era, but can be seen as a refl ective challenge to contemporary listening practices. ==Mixtape nostalgia asks us to rethink how digitally mediated environments currently operate==." ([Fenby-Hulse 2016:184](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=14))

"RETHINKING THE DIGITAL PLAYLIST: MIXTAPES, NOSTALGIA... 185 erful political medium (Ball 2011 Manual 2001 ). Operating outside online censorship and surveillance, the cassette enabled both artists and listeners to challenge the music industry and the idea of consumer culture." ([Fenby-Hulse 2016:185](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=15))

"While digital music platforms have offered a solution to digital piracy, they are rigid in their structure and outlook, providing a prepackaged and predominantly Western approach to music listening. Issues of access, ethics, power and culture, as well as issues of individual creativity and expression, have yet to be suffi ciently addressed by digital music providers." ([Fenby-Hulse 2016:185](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=15))

"In sum, we now to need to consider how to go beyond music as listening and think about music as a dynamic and social experience that is creative, haptic, performative, immersive and embodied." ([Fenby-Hulse 2016:186](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X4R2WNXK?page=16))
