[[Libby as an example of artificial scarcity]]

* Bitcoin and artificial scarcity
  * NFTs mimic analog scarcity
    * Does this create a psychosis, to paraphrase LM Sacasas?

The boom of NFTs centers around *artificial scarcity*: imposing constraints onto the usually abundant digital world. Is this a good idea, though? [Dan Cohen points out](https://buttondown.email/dancohen/archive/humane-ingenuity-35-bounded-and-boundless/) that this idea of creating uniqueness has been done before: for instance, the Wu-Tang Clan [released a single-copy album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_Shaolin) (that was bought by Martin Shkreli). What they wrote on their website at the time is predates what NFT advocates are writing today:

> The music industry is in crisis. The intrinsic value of music has been reduced to zero. Contemporary art is worth millions by virtue of its exclusivity ... By adopting a 400 year old Renaissance-style approach to music, offering it as a commissioned commodity and allowing it to take a similar trajectory from creation to exhibition to sale ... we hope to inspire and intensify urgent debates about the future of music.

Another example: science fiction writer [William Gibson released a poem stored on a floppy disk which encrypted itself after single use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrippa_\(A_Book_of_the_Dead\)) in 1992. Artificial scarcity is not a new concept.

Some argue that artificial scarcity is cold and inhumane. That forging authenticity for profit is an impropriety on the spiritual conduit of art. Time is the best judge, after all: it shows us what we want to remember, what we want to hold up, what we want to make unique.

I'm sympathetic to that argument, but I don't fully buy it. In 2021, all scarcity is imposed in some way.

I'm participating in an interesting "immersive theatrical experience" called "[Artistic Stamp](https://artisticstamp.com/)", where the entire "play" takes place over letters by mail. The characters write to me, and I write them back with my thoughts or an answer to a question. It's fun, but I was especially taken when I got my first letter: it was hand-written and addressed to me. It felt special. But just like digital scarcity, the entire thing is an artifice: we're imposing these limitations by conducting a story over mail. We can say that COVID forced us into this, but the choice is still there: it's intentional scarcity --- and it feels good!

This type of deliberate artificial scarcity makes a choice to appeal to a specific type of person. But this is essentially what everything does! Choices are always made when things are created of what and who it might appeal to, whether they're explicitly made or not. [As Drew Austin points out](https://kneelingbus.substack.com/p/153-incunabula), scarcity has become more and more of a conscious design choice. In 2021, we're no longer bound by geographical constraints; the internet connects us all. While in the past you might have had to stand outside of McDonalds and hand out your music tapes to passerby like [Daniel Johnston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Johnston) did in the 1980s, using anything but the internet to release music in 2021 carries with it a conscious decision of self-imposed scarcity and perhaps a dash of irony.

I get a lot of the distaste for NFTs --- the crypto world has many slimy evils, [as I've written about](https://guscuddy.substack.com/p/the-curtain-094-nfts-crypto-and-the) --- but the idea that creating artificial scarcity is some sort of evil ignores the realities of the internet in 2021, and falls into a romantic nostalgia trap. The bigger problem with NFTs is that much of this artificial scarcity is created without consideration because the whole thing is driven by a gold rush. But even still, artists are getting paid directly for their work because of this artificial scarcity, correcting the biggest strength and sin of the internet: its unlimited abundance, which brought the music industry to its knees. Removing the environmental concerns (and yes, I've read the articles, I know they're huge) --- is that anything to complain about?
