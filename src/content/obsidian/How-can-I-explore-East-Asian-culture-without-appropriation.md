#private #note/question

This is is on my mind when thinking about [[Japan|Japan]], and [[China|China]] in particular.

I've been trying to approach and learn about these cultures from what I think of as two perspectives:

* The "top down" globalized version, which looks at their history and politics and how my idea of these countries has been warped, for example, by American propaganda
* The "bottom up" version which looks their cuisine, culture, language, people. I've been trying to cook more, for instance, with [[Chinese Cooking]]. That's totally new to me and a great way to learn more about their culture — but when does it border on [[appropriation]]?
