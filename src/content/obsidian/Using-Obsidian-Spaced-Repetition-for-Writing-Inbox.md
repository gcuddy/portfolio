I use the [Obsidian Spaced Repetition plugin](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition) to implement a version of [[Andy Matuschak]]'s ["Writing Inbox"](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/A_writing_inbox_for_transient_and_incomplete_notes).

Here's how I do it.

I mark notes with the `#review` tag. These are notes I want to "keep alive" but review some indefinite time in the future. Not done, but incrementally work on. I can put prompts in here, half-finished notes, etc. I find this works best with [[Evergreen (or Atomic) Notes]], though I've also experimented with more traditional "notes on a subject" that I want to revisit. (The problem there is in the actionability â€” I guess I could progressively summarize?)

Then each day, I can open a few notes for review. Fruitful notes/prompts I will mark as "hard", if I'm unsure/want to skip I'll mark as "medium", and if it's not very fruitful I'll mark as "easy", which pushes it further down the road.

The plugin puts an interface in the sidebar but I don't really enjoy using it. Luckily there is great hotkey support. Here is how I have it set up:

`ctrl+r`: Open note for review
`ctrl+1`: Mark note as easy
`ctrl+2`: Mark note as medium
`ctrl+3`: Mark note as hard

When there's no more notes to review, it displays a nice message. And that's it!

More open questions:

* Should this be just for Evergreen notes, or all notes?
* When do I mark a note as "done"?
* Do I mark a note as "easy" if it's in a good place? How I differentiate from "unfruitful"?
* Does the "Incremental Writing" plugin also work to this effect?
