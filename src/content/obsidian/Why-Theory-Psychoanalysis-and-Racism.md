- show:: Why Theory
- summary:: Ryan and Todd discuss the encounter between psychoanalytic theory and the problem of racism. They focus on the role that enjoyment plays in racism and why racism is necessary for the survival of capitalist society. They also address the problem of white privilege as a signifier. During this discussion, they deal with two outstanding books on racism, Racecraft by Barbara and Karen Fields, and Trauma and Race by Sheldon George.
