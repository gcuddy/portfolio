## Highlights

> It is possible to learn to give yourself bliss, pleasure, joy, happiness, and fulfillment, at any time, on demand. It’s surprisingly easy. **You shift what you pay attention to, and how – and suddenly you are in a state of bliss**. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515698))

- The bliss states, or [[jhanas]], are a series of concentration states. You can learn to enter these states through meditation techniques.
  Jhanās feel great: they are extremely pleasurable, and very relaxing for the body and for the mind. They **likely have psychological benefits, and are classically considered ideal if not necessary for the path to awakening** ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515700))

- Different people talk about jhanā differently, which can be very confusing. Here, we’re discussing what are sometimes referred to as the lighter jhanās or the “sutta jhanās.” These lighter jhanās are very real, relatively easy to get into, and truly life changing. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515702))
- To begin, be sure you’re familiar with the [[Five Hindrances]]. **You cannot enter a bliss state if you are in a hindrance, so cutting through them in a given meditation session is necessary**. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515706))
- Once you have cut through the hindrances, you can use any meditation technique to enter a bliss state. **The most common techniques used to enter bliss states are following the breath, doing body scans, and doing loving kindness meditation – but any technique can work**. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515708))
- The instructions are simple: do a technique you are familiar with, and attend to the relevant focus space. **If and when it starts to be enjoyable in the body, and the enjoyment is stable, then you shift your focus space to this pleasure and enjoyment in the body**.
  To put it very simply: **do a technique that feels good, and then enjoy it. Really enjoy it**. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515709))
- Although there are many roads to entering bliss states, I’ve found that in practice, **loving kindness meditation is one of the most direct**. This is because for most people – by my estimates, roughly four out of five people – loving kindness feels or can feel really good. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515714))
- **[[Standing meditation]], or Zhan Zhuang, is a valuable complementary practice. A daily standing practice, starting with five minutes, working up to at least twenty minutes, will help you to charge the energy body. It will** be easier to notice and enter these bliss states if you have high amounts of energy in the body.
  **If you do these two things frequently, loving kindness practice and standing meditation, then you’re going to feel increasingly good**. You’re going to feel relaxed physically, you’ll be increasing the amount of energy in your body, and you’re going to feel happy emotionally. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515716))
- Understanding the **distinction between attention and awareness**, or foreground and background, is helpful for entering and transitioning between bliss states. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515718))
- Attention is the foreground of your experience. You are attending to your breath or to your whole body or to the feelings of loving kindness in your body. You’re placing your attention on some aspect of your experience in the foreground. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515720))
- Awareness is the background. It’s background awareness of everything in your experience: your body, your mind, and the world around you. That includes your whole physical and emotional and energetic body: every aspect of your body that you’re in touch with. It includes your mind, your state of mind: the thoughts and emotions you are experiencing. It also includes the space of the room that you’re in, any sounds that you can hear, and the temperature. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515721))
- **Whole body awareness is extremely important for jhanā practice**. Be aware of and feel your whole body while you do a technique: not just spatially, but also qualitatively. You want to have an awareness that can notice phenomena like muscular tension or relaxation, or energy flow, or emotional blockages, and respond appropriately ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515722))
- In the Pali Canon, the oldest extant texts from the Buddhist tradition discuss the Eight Jhanās. These jhanās come in two sets: the first four (the form or rupa jhanās) and the second four (the formless or arupa jhanās). The major distinction is that the first four are states that you can get into, whereas the second four are described as being more like places or realms that you can go to. These states are qualitatively different: you’re entering a place. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515724))
- Although it’s useful to review the factors in depth for serious jhanā practice, in this post, I’ll discuss the two factors that are most useful to know about for entering the form jhanās: pīti and sukha ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515728))
- Pīti is more physical or energetic, whereas sukha is more emotional. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515730))
- Pīti will show up in different ways for different people. It could feel like vibration, warmth, tingling energy. Often it can be very intense. It’s usually very enjoyable when you first encounter it, but often over time it becomes less enjoyable. Many people that do a lot of jhanā practice develop a distaste for pīti and its intensity. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515734))
- Sukha is more emotional: it’s an emotional form of happiness. For me, I usually feel it around my mouth. That’s why it’s often a good idea to establish and maintain a smile while meditating – to kickstart this happiness, this sukha. You don’t need to maintain a smile if it’s hard, but you do want to go in the direction of emotional happiness, and smiling helps with that. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515749))
- In the first jhanā, both pīti and sukha are present. However, the physical pleasure or intense pleasure in the body is more prominent. It’s in the foreground. You have your attention on the pīti. The sukha is actually pretty quiet and it’s in the background. You might not even notice it first, as it can be quite subtle. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515755))
- In the second jhanā, these are flipped: both the pīti and sukha are present, but the sukha is more prominent. It’s in the foreground of your experience, whereas the pīti is in your background awareness. In the first jhanā, you place your attention on the pīti, whereas in the second one, your focus space is the sukha. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515757))
- In the first jhanā, you can still have discursive thinking in the background, but in the second jhanā, thinking decreases dramatically to the point of there being no thinking. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515758))
- In the third jhanā, the pīti drops away — there’s just the sukha. With the pīti gone, it actually changes qualitatively to be more like contentment, rather than happiness or joy. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515760))
- In the fourth jhanā, the sukha also drops away. There’s no sukha, and no pīti. It’s just equanimity, calm equanimity. This is also a form of happiness, but it’s not physical or emotional. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515762))
- To get into the first jhanā, you shift your attention from whatever the meditation object was – the breath, body sensations, metta, a sound – anything – to enjoyable sensations in the body. Then, you use your mindfulness of those sensations to generate pīti. That’s the first jhanā.
  To get into the second jhanā, you shift your attention to the sukha; for the third, to the contentment (the sukha without the pīti); and then for the fourth, to the absence of both pīti and sukha. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515766))
- The spectrum model presents an alternative to the Eight Jhanās model, or other maps of the territory of bliss states. I first heard about this through Rob Burbea, but others talk about it as well.
  This model is seeing jhanā as a spectrum of frequencies that you can tune your consciousness to.
  It’s less that there are specific bliss states, which you are either in or not. Instead, there’s an attitude that acknowledges that there are many bliss states available, all of which feel good. They blend into each other, and there’s no real limit. So the only thing that makes sense to do is to explore.
  This model is really helpful because one of the biggest hindrances to jhanā practice is essentially skeptical doubt in the form of asking, “Am I in it or not? Have I ever been in it? Am I good enough to get into it?” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515772))
- The spectrum model allows for increasing depth. Wherever you are on the spectrum, there are probably deeper states than where you’ve been. From that perspective it matters less if you’ve been in a particular state or not – you’re just like, “Hey, this was great! It felt good!” And you keep exploring. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515781))
- When you get into these states, you just stay in them and enjoy them – you really just enjoy them, let them soak in.
  From that perspective, the more time you can give to these kinds of practices, the more your nervous system is going to become accustomed to these bliss states, and the more that you’ll find yourself in them – and that will lead to more and more enjoyment, too. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515783))
- The Buddha said the only problem with jhanās is that they’re temporary. They’re wholesome, they’re beneficial, they’re enjoyable. He strongly recommended that you learn to do them and enjoy them.
  However, they’re only states. They come and they go. But if you marinate in them, you can learn how to get in them at any time, and get in them more frequently. They become more common in your experience. They do still arise and pass away, fade in and out, but that’s the only downside. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1446131733/17515787))
