In [[web2]], programming became associated with working for a large, boring company like one of the FAANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) or other relatively same-y content tech companies.

But that doesn't need to be the case. [[Everything in web2 looks the same]], which is a result of this boring attitude. [[web3]] definitely promises to have more fun, but it's intertwined with a problematic crypto scene.

There are many programmers/creative technologists (how to define?) that are making work outside of both of those scenes entirely:

* [[Kicks Condor]]
* [[Weiwei Xu]]
* [[Robin Sloan]]
* many others...

[[Xiaowei Wang]], too, probably fits into this space. She co-founded [[Logic Magazine]] — though I'm not sure how much actual programming/engineering she's doing these days. But she's approaching technology in creative ways — like her cooking chapters in [[Blockchain Chicken Farm]]. She is [[Mixing physical with digital (computing and physicality)]]

Still, there's a class of people doing a sort of creative anthropology of technology that I find interesting.

There's *many* directions the prompt of creative programming could be taken in — especially in web3, and with virtual characters like Lil Miquela. The ones that intermingle with art I catalog here: [[Art and simulation]]
