**Race as Floating Signifier** What W.E.B. Du Bois called the differences of color, hair, and bone; what everyone understands as visible racial differences. Hall examines the inner workings of the system and tries to unlock the secret of how and why race matters so much to people. Hall does not necessarily focus on the effects of racism as he takes those as his starting point. Now, as a result, some people have accused him of not paying enough attention to the practical outcomes and violence associated with racism. Nothing could be further from the truth, Hall is passionately concerned with the psychological, cultural, and physical violence that racism inflicts, but he believes there’s a better fight against it. People have to first understand the logic of how it works. He wants to understand how racism is cultivated in one’s imaginations, of how it works in one’s head, so that people can better combat it on the streets.

Hall’s basic argument is that all attempts to scientifically show racial inferiority have failed. And yet there is a persistent and widespread belief in white supremacy. To understand why this should be the case, Hall argues that we have to pay attention, not to the objective facts of the situation alone, but to the stories the culture spins for us about what the physical differences we are born with mean. This involves examining the discourses that surround race. Taking what he calls a “discursive position”. That is, analyzing the metaphors, the antidotes, the stories, the jokes that are told by culture about what physical racial differences mean. In fact, when you do this, you see that historically things like skin color have been given many different meanings over the years. There is nothing solid or permanent to the meaning of race. It changes all the time. It shifts and slides. That’s why it’s called **The Floating Signifier**. What racial difference signifies is never static or the same. This sounds very theoretical and abstract but Hall’s motivation for insisting on this strategy is not at all academic. It is only once we understand how racism works that we can struggle against it and understanding it takes hard, analytical work.

**Words by Hall:  
**“What do I mean by a floating signifier? Well to put it crudely, race is one of those major concepts, which organize the great classificatory systems of difference, which operate in human society. And to say that race is a discursive category recognizes that all attempts to ground this concept scientifically, to locate differences between the races, on what one might call scientific, biological, or genetic grounds, have been largely shown to be untenable. We must therefore, it is said, substitute a socio-historical or cultural definition of race, for the biological one.”

**Race works like a language  
**“_Race works like a language._ And signifiers refer to the systems and concepts of the classification of a culture to its _making meaning_ practices. And those things gain their meaning, not because of what they contain in their essence, but in the shifting relations of difference, which they establish with other concepts and ideas in a signifying field. Their meaning, because it is relational, and not essential, can never be finally fixed, but is subject to the constant process of redefinition and appropriation.”

![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1474/0404/files/Screen-Shot-2018-03-12-at-11.20.11-768x560_480x480.png?v=1592597127)

“The meaning of a signifier can never be finally or trans-historically fixed. That is, it is always, or there is always, a certain sliding of meaning, always a margin not yet encapsulated in language and meaning, always something about race left unsaid, always someone a constitutive outside, who’s very existence the identity of race depends on, and which is absolutely destined to return from its expelled and objected position outside the signifying field to trouble the dreams of those who are comfortable inside.”

“Alright, you might say perhaps race is not after all a matter of genetic factors, of biology, of physiological characteristics, of the morphology of the body, not a matter of color, hair, and bone, that chilling threesome that DuBois frequently quotes.” But you may say, “can you seriously be claiming that it is simply a signifier, an empty sign, that it is not fixed in its inner nature, that it cannot be secured in its meaning, that it floats in a sea of relational differences?”

“You know, in Fanon’s book Black Skin White Masks, whereas I said he’s entranced and he’s obsessed by the trauma of his own appearance and what it means, he is driven wild by the fact that he is caught, caught and locked in this body which the white other knows just by looking at him that the other can see through him just by reading the text of the black body. He’s obsessed by that fact. And yet, as I am sure you know, when it came to it, the power and importance of Black Skin White Masks is that Fanon understood that beneath what he called the bodily and corporeal schema is another schema. A schema composed of the stories and the anecdotes and the metaphors and the images, which is really, really he says, what constructs the relationship between the body and its social and cultural space. These stories, not the fact itself. The fact itself is just exactly that trap of the surface, which allows us to rest with what is obvious. It’s so manifestly there. The trap in racism is precisely to allow what is manifestly there what offers it to us as a symptom of appearance to stand in the place of what is in fact one of the most profound and deeply complex of the cultural systems which allow us to make a distinction between inside and outside, between us and them, between who belongs and who doesn’t belong. That apparently simple, obvious and banal fact requires the invocation of territories of knowledge in order to produce it as a simple, obvious, visible fact. In this way race is more like sexual difference, racial difference is more like sexual difference than it is like the other systems of difference precisely because anatomy, physiology appears to wind the question up and what we know about and have learned gradually about sexual difference that is to say the profundity of the depth that lies behind the making of that distinction is what we need now to begin to learn about the languages of race which we speak.”

**An empty sign?  
**“I have to say it again because I can feel the sense of relief that after skirting around through these various structures we have come to know after all what we all know about race. It’s reality. You can see its effects, you can see it in the faces of the people around you, you can see people pulling the skirts aside as people from another racial group come into the room. You can see the operation of racial discrimination in institutions and so on. What is the need of this entire scholarly hullabaloo about race, when you can just turn to its reality?”

“There are probably differences of all sorts in the world, that difference is a kind of anomalous existence out there, a kind of random series of all sorts of things in what you call the world, there’s no reason to deny this reality or this diversity. ... It’s only when these differences have been organized within language, within discourse, within systems of meaning, that the differences can be said to acquire meaning and become a factor in human culture and regulate conduct, that is the nature of what I’m calling the discursive concept of race. Not that nothing exists of differences, but that what matters are the systems we use to make sense, to make human societies intelligible. The system we bring to those differences, how we organize those differences into systems of meaning, with which, as it were, we could find the world intelligible.

I think these are discursive systems because the interplay between the representation of racial difference, the writing of power, and the production of knowledge, is crucial to the way in which they are generated, and the way in which they function. And I use the word discursive here to mark the transition theoretically from the more formal understanding of difference to an understanding of how ideas and knowledge of difference organize human practices between individuals.”

**Encoding/Decoding  
**Hall takes a semiotic approach and builds on the work of Roland Barthes and Umberto Eco. The essay takes up and challenges long held assumptions about how media messages are produced, circulated and consumed, proposing a new theory of communication. "The 'object' of production practices and structures in television is the production of a message: that is, a sign-vehicle or rather sign-vehicles of a specific kind organized, like any other form of communication or language, through the operation of codes, within the syntagmatic chains of a discourse".

![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1474/0404/files/large_330b945af6719e8de4f5476539c11285_480x480.jpg?v=1592597127)

According to Hall, "a message must be perceived as meaningful discourse and be meaningfully de-coded before it has an effect, a use, or satisfies a need". There are four codes of the Encoding/Decoding Model of Communication. The first way of encoding is the dominant (i.e. **hegemonic)** code. This is the code the encoder expects the decoder to recognize and decode. "When the viewer takes the connoted meaning full and straight and decodes the message in terms of the reference-code in which it has been coded, it operates inside the dominant code." The second way of encoding is the **professional** code. It operates in tandem with the dominant code. "It serves to reproduce the dominant definitions precisely by bracketing the hegemonic quality, and operating with professional codings which relate to such questions as visual quality, news and presentational values, televisual quality, 'professionalism' etc." The third way of encoding is the **negotiated** code. "It acknowledges the legitimacy of the hegemonic definitions to make the grand significations, while, at a more restricted, situational level, it makes its own ground-rules, it operates with 'exceptions' to the rule". The fourth way of encoding is the **oppositional** code, also known as the globally contrary code. "It is possible for a viewer to perfectly understand both the literal and connotative inflection given to an event, but to determine to decode the message in a globally contrary way." "Before this message can have an 'effect' (however defined), or satisfy a 'need' or be put to a 'use', it must first be perceived as a meaningful discourse and meaningfully de-coded."

Hall challenged all four components of the mass communications model. He argues that (a) meaning is not simply fixed or determined by the sender; (b) the message is never transparent; and (c) the audience is not a passive recipient of meaning. For example, a documentary film on asylum seekers that aims to provide a sympathetic account of their plight does not guarantee that audiences will feel sympathetic. Despite being realistic and recounting facts, the documentary must still communicate through a sign system (the aural-visual signs of TV) that simultaneously distorts the producers' intentions and evokes contradictory feelings in the audience.

Distortion is built into the system, rather than being a "failure" of the producer or viewer. There is a "lack of fit", Hall argues, "between the two sides in the communicative exchange"—that is, between the moment of the production of the message ("encoding") and the moment of its reception ("decoding"). In "Encoding/decoding", Hall suggests media messages accrue commonsense status in part through their performative nature. Through the repeated performance, staging or telling of the narrative of "9/11" (as an example; there are others like it), a culturally specific interpretation becomes not only plausible and universal but elevated to "common sense".

Our society has reached a point where both the oppositional and preferred readings cannot see each other’s perspectives. Hall states that “One of the most significant political moments (they also coincide with crisis points within the broadcasting organizations themselves, for obvious reasons) is the point when events which are normally signified and decoded in a negotiated way begin to be given an oppositional reading. Here the ‘politics of signification’ — the struggle in discourse — is joined.” Hall does not give a solution on how to escape from this issue, but he does give us a better understanding of how it happens.

**Views on cultural identity and the African diaspora  
**In his influential 1996 essay “Cultural Identity and Diaspora”, Hall presents two different definitions of cultural identity. In the first definition, cultural identity is a "a sort of collective 'one true self'… which many people with a shared history and ancestry hold in common." In this view, cultural identity provides a "stable, unchanging and continuous frame of reference and meaning" through the ebb and flow of historical change. This allows the tracing back of the origins of descendants and reflecting on the historical experiences of ancestors as a shared truth. Therefore, blacks living in the diaspora need only "unearth" their African past to discover their true cultural identity. While Hall appreciates the good effects this first view of cultural identity has had in the postcolonial world, he proposes a second definition of cultural identity that he views as superior.  

![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1474/0404/files/large_fc2e93cb965bbc925391e459b17b45bb_480x480.png?v=1592597127)

Hall's second definition of cultural identity "recognizes that, as well as the many points of similarity, there are also critical points of deep and significant difference which constitute 'what we really are'; or rather – since history has intervened – 'what we have become.’” In this view, cultural identity is not a fixed essence rooted in the past. Instead, cultural identities “undergo constant transformation” throughout history as they are "subject to the continuous 'play' of history, culture, and power". Thus Hall defines cultural identities as “the names we give to the different ways we are positioned by, and position ourselves within, the narratives of the past.” This view of cultural identity was more challenging than the previous due to its dive into deep differences, but nonetheless it showed the mixture of the African diaspora."In other words, for Hall cultural identity is "not an essence but a positioning".

**Policing the Crisis  
**In the 13 months between August 1972 and August 1973, 60 events were reported as muggings in the national daily newspapers. Dramatic individual cases of such crimes were highlighted in the media. On the 15th of August 1972, Arthur Hills was stabbed to death near Waterloo station. For the first time, a specific crime in Britain was labelled a mugging in the press. On the 5th of November 1972, Robert Keenan was attacked by three youths in Birmingham. He was knocked to the ground, and had some keys, five cigarettes and 30 pence stolen. Two hours later, the youths returned to where he lay, and they viciously kicked him and hit him with a brick.

![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1474/0404/files/large_0dcb842bbab93f6545e1ca97dcd17128_480x480.jpg?v=1592597127)

It was stories such as these that highlighted an apparently new and frightening type of crime. Judges, police and the politicians lined up with the media in stressing the threat that this crime posed to society.  Many commentators believed and thus the discourse became that the streets of Britain would soon become as those in New York and Chicago. The Home Secretary in the House of Commons quoted an alarming figure of a 129% increase in Muggings in London in the previous four years.

![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1474/0404/files/f9656c3ba66e30526c22da414f6e45f4_480x480.jpg?v=1592597127)

Hall sees these reactions as a moral panic. (An exaggerated outburst of public concern over the morality and behavior of a group in society). Hall tried to explain why there should be such a strong reaction to, and widespread fear of, mugging. Hall rejected the view that the panic was inevitable and understandable reaction to new and rapidly increasing forms of violence. As far back as the nineteenth century, footpads and garrotters had committed violent street crimes similar to those of the modern mugger.  Violent robberies were not, therefore a new crime at all – indeed, as recently as 1968, an MP had been kicked and robbed in the street without the crime being labelled a mugging.

![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1474/0404/files/large_1114f5715373817780edd7687214613b_480x480.jpg?v=1592597127)

Hall noted that there is no legally defined crime as mugging. Since in law there is no such crime, it was not possible for the Home Secretary accurately to measure its extent. Hall’s study found no basis in the criminal statistics for his figure of 129% rise over four years. From Hall’s examination of the statistics there was no evidence that violent crime was particularly rising fast in this period leading up to the panic. Using the nearest legal category to mugging – assault with intent to rob – the official statistics showed an annual rise of an average of 33.4% between 1955 and 1965, but only a 14% average annual increase from 1965 to 1972. This type of crime was growing more slowly as the time the panic took place than it had done so in previous decades.

For these reasons Hall could not accept that the supposed novelty or rate of increase of the crime explained the moral panic. He argued that both mugging and the moral panic could only be explained in the context of the problems faced by British capitalism at the start of the 1970s.

![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1474/0404/files/large_759334acdae2e18ad3da2c8460dda020_480x480.png?v=1592597128)

**Capitalism, Crisis and Crime  
**Economic problems produced part of the ‘crisis’. Hall accepted the Marxist view that capitalist economies tend to go through periods of crisis when it is difficult for firms to sell goods at a profit. The crisis of British society, however, went beyond economic problems.  It was a crisis of ‘hegemony’. Hegemony is political leadership and ideological domination of society.  Accordingly, the state tends to be dominated by parts of the ruling class.  They attempt to win support for their policies and ideas from other groups in society (to maintain power). They try to persuade the working class that the authority of the state exercised fairly and justly in the interests of all (not just themselves). **A crisis in hegemony takes place when the authority of the state and the ruling class is challenged.**

![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1474/0404/files/large_8b55a8a233df4f510ee090f6801bdc46_480x480.jpg?v=1592597127)

In 1970-72 the British state faced both an economic crisis and a crisis of hegemony. From 1945 until about 1968 there had been what Hall called an inter-class truce, there was little conflict between the ruling and subject class. Full employment, rising living standards and the expansion of the welfare state secured support for the state and the acceptance of its authority by the working class. As unemployment rose and living standards ceased to rise rapidly, the basis of the inter-class truce was undermined it became more difficult for the ruling class to govern by consent.

Hall provides a number of examples of the challenge to the authority to the hegemony of the state:

1. Northern Ireland generated into open warfare.
2. There was a growth in student militancy and increased activity in the black power movement
3. Trade unions were seen to pose the biggest threat as miners launched ‘flying pickets’ to prevent coal from reaching power stations/key industries and to hold the state to ransom

Since the government was no longer able to rule by consent, it turned to the use of force to control the crises. It was in this context that street crime became an issue. Mugging was presented as a key element in a break-down of law and order. Violence was portrayed as a threat to stability of society, and it was the black mugger who was used to symbolize the threat of violence.

![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1474/0404/files/large_e748d060f2ae1035636e3a9c6ec1ca36_480x480.jpg?v=1592597127)

In this way the public could be persuaded that society’s problems were caused by ‘immigrants’ rather than the faults of the capitalist system they are (people may steal because they are ‘made’ poor). The working class was effectively divided on racial grounds, since the white working class was encouraged to direct its frustrations towards the black working class.

  

**Race Is The Modality In Which Class Is Lived  
**"Race is the modality in which class is “lived”, the medium through which class relations are experienced, the form in which it is appropriated and “fought through”.’ What marks out Hall’s analysis as so innovative is the way he further develops his conception of ideology to analytically capture questions of identity formation and resistance to domination.

![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1474/0404/files/tumblr_85e61794a4cf05c2049e254cd0b95fa4_0de26457_1280_480x480.jpg?v=1592600956)

Stuart Hall wrote in Policing the Crisis, “Race is the modality in which class is lived.” There is no class experience that is not also a racialized (and gendered) class experience. Neoliberalism secured its hegemony because it acted along these multiple dimensions in order to defeat black and Third World collectivism as much as the solidarities of white labor movements. Racial populism and neoliberalism were born together and unite in times of crisis. Only by fighting the two together can either one of them be defeated.

![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1474/0404/files/large_4cef01cd7757cd30e64ba86b85e32c1a_480x480.png?v=1592597127)

Race is a necessary fiction for capitalism, just as is private property, just as is the idea that you can be free at the same time that you must sell yourself to another if you wish to eat. Conversely, a conception of “class” (and class struggle) confined to a normative national, social history of wage labor, one that excludes social relations anchored in rightlessness, wagelessness, and extra-economic coercion, obscures the violence constituting capitalism’s capacity to reproduce itself. It is that violence that undergirds the well-known formulation by Stuart Hall and his comrades, “race is the modality in which class is lived,” capturing the fundamental social experience of the unity of race and class.

Hall points out that anti-racist projects focusing on reconstructing a national culture so those racialized as minorities can find legitimate positions from which to speak within it are as important as more traditional forms of class struggle.
