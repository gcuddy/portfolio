A common refrain one hears when thinking about theater is its "ephemerality" (see: [[↯ What is the defining "thing" of theatre?]]). Theater takes a lot of work, goes up, and then it's done. That's it. Like fireworks, it explodes — then dissolves into nothing. There might be an archival recording of it, but also like fireworks these recordings almost never capture the same feeling as "being there"; worse, recordings often degrade the quality of the work, as the stage feels awkward on the foreign medium of film.

This ephemerality has been central to my thinking around theater for quite a while. That's part of what makes it so special! Like life, it's imperfect and mortal — Shakespeare's "all the world's a stage" metaphor extended. (Related: this ephemerality is quite wasteful! An open question: [[How can theater be more environmentally sustainable?]])

But some forms of streaming theater have challenged this notion. Streaming of pre-recorded theater puts the ephemerality equation in jeopardy — even when the "original" stream was live.

Helen Shaw has also suggested something similar, albeit for different reasons --- shows should repeat! (Alas, can't find the link to this one)
This is similar: https://diversalarums.com/2015/12/29/helen-shaws-best-shows-of-2015-the-ones-that-should-come-back/
This article actually raises a good point: the European repertory theater model (ie Schaubühne) keeps shows around and repeats them.
But alas, the point remains, albeit on a different scale: a show will eventually disappear. We still watch movies from 50 years ago; we don't watch theater from 50 years ago — nor should we. (We do, however, do versions of plays from 50 years ago, which is an important distinction.)

* The value of non-ephemeral (?) theater can be seen in pieces like [[@wang2021CovidClosedTheaters]]
* Theater's ephemerality can also be seen as its central emptiness, ie it is created and disappears in the moment, not just on a production scale — see [[Theater is created with a spontaneous web of conditions, ala dependent arising in Buddhism]]
* This might also be useful: [[Bay-Cheng\_2012\_Theater Is Media.pdf]]

* Is Ephemerality the same thing as Scarcity?
