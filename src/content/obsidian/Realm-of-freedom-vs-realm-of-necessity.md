Great #coinage  from Martin Hagglund in his book This Life (not sure if it's originally Hagglund's idea or not).

Under Capitalism, we never actually shrink the realm of necessity. The realm of necessity is *the labor required to keep ourselves alive*. Importantly, as humans we have surplus time â€” we don't need to necessarily spend all of our alive time solely on biological survival. The realm of freedom is the time where we can ask  ourselves what we actually ought to be doing.

The aim of a truly democratic society which values [[spiritual freedom]] would be to **decrease the realm of necessity and increase the realm of freedom**. Theoretically, this is what [[technology]] *should* do. But as many can astutely point out, under capitalism this has *not* been the major role of technology, since [[capitalism necessarily depends on exploited labor]], and technological development regularly necessitates *more* labor. 

%%this should probably be its own note%%
The primary value of a society should not be profit (and thus living in the realm of necessity for the proletariat), but should be increasing the realm of freedom for all. This is why we do not actually have freedom and liberty under capitalism. People are forced to work alienating jobs to live. Labor is alienating because the driver is profit â€” we can't see a collective good / collective power in the labor we do, because we know we are ultimately lining the pockets of a capitalist. If we were instead laboring with a  collective understanding that we were increasing the realm of freedom, labor would be less alienating.

#note/refactor 

One can see that most people, naturally, desire the realm of freedom. Rich venture capitalists talk about having enough money to be able to wake up and choose to do what you want (I know there's several [[Naval Ravikant]] tweets about this). That's what "fuck you" money is about. Everyone making under six figures wants enough money to... quit their job, relax, and be able to do/pursue *what they actually want*. Importantly, the realm of freedom *does not* mean that we all just laze around doing nothing. The realm of freedom means actually opening up the critical question of what we *ought to do with our time* to all people. 

(Per a recent conversatoin with [[ê†œ Ryder]]: "how many geniuses are stuck making sandwiches?" )
