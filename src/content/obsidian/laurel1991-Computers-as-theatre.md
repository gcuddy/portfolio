description:: Brenda Laurel's _Computers as Theatre_ revolutionized the field of human-computer interaction, offering ideas that inspired generations of interface and interaction designers-and continue to inspire them. Laurel's insight was that effective interface design, like effective drama, must engage the user directly in an experience involving both thought and emotion. Her practical conclusion was that a user's enjoyment must be a paramount design consideration, and this demands a deep awareness of dramatic theory and technique, both ancient and modern.

See [[Jason Yuan]] on this idea too: [[Jason Yuan Thread on Software Design as Stage Design and Theatre]]

## Notes

Laurel's other books look very worth reading as well: Other employers include Atari, Activision, and Apple. Her books include
The Art of Human-Computer Interface Design (1990), Computers as Theatre
(1991), Utopian Entrepreneur (2001), and Design Research: Methods and Per-
spectives (2004). She earned her BA (1972) from Depauw University and her
MFA (1975) and PhD in theatre (1986) from Ohio State University.

Interaction:

> The answer gets to the heart of this book. Theatre is about interaction, about themes and con- flicts, goals and approaches to those goals, frustration, success, tension, and then the resolution of that tension. Theatre is dynamic, changing, al- ways in motion. Our modern technologies with their powerful comput- ers, multiple sensors, communication links, and displays are also about interaction, and treating that interaction as theatre proves to be rich, en- lightening, and powerful.

Screens used to be static displays — but now they're fully interactive. This reminds me also of a bad theatre set being a static stage picture, whereas great sets are dynamic and fluid, considering energy/interaction/bodies in motion.

> Real interaction does not take place in the moment, on a fixed, static screen. Real interaction is ongoing over a protracted period. It ebbs and flows, transitions from one state to another. Transitions are as important as states

> “All the world’s a stage,” said Jaques in William Shakespeare’s As You Like It, “and all the men and women merely players.” For us, the computer and its various programs and applications are the stage, providing the platform on which we enact our own scenes and activities. Much as plays are di- vided into acts, sometimes with intermissions, our computer-based activi- ties are divided into sessions, sometimes separated by short periods and other times by long breaks.

> When a break in activities is caused by interruptions from com- peting activities, when we resume the initial task, if the playwright (that is, the programmer or system designer) does not provide reminders of the previous states and activities, the result can be errors in the conduct of criti- cal tasks. Witness errors in the use of medical systems, in aviation, and in complex activities that range from cooking a meal to controlling a complex chemical plant. Just as playwrights must help the audience bridge time gaps, the designers of systems must help computer users bridge their gaps.

> in the early 1980s while I was still at Atari Research, I began talking with Alan Kay and Don Norman about a particular idée fixe: the notion that when people were using computers they were interacting in representational worlds, much more like plays in which they were characters than comput- ers on which they ran programs

Theater and computing are both fundamentally based in metaphor

> The MIT hackers weren’t the only ones to invent Spacewar!. As Alan Kay noted, “the game of Spacewar! blos- soms spontaneously wherever there is a graphics display connected to a computer” (Brand 1974).

> Why was Spacewar! the “natural” thing to build with this new technol- ogy? Why not build a pie chart, an au- tomated kaleidoscope, or a desktop?

> This simplistic notion of conversation led many early interface special- ists to develop a model of interaction that treats human and computer as two distinct parties whose “conversation” is mediated by the screen. But as advances in linguistics demonstrated, there is more to conversation than tit for tat.

> Interface design often is initially fluidly variant and later rather sticky, or conservative, as is seen in the history of automobiles. Automotive control inter- faces initially resembled small boats in that they were steered with tillers (often with the driver in the rear) and featured hand controls for power and braking. A profusion of such designs existed in the 19th century. These evolved at the turn of the 20th century into a canonical set of controls that we would easily recog- nize today, with the steering wheel placed in front of an off-side driver in the front. The first car with a steer- ing wheel was the single seat 4hp Panard racer in 1894, and the first production automobile with the driver and steering wheel on the left was Thomas B. Jeffery’s 1904 Rambler (the 1903 Rambler was steered with a tiller).

> n her work in applying the notion of common ground to human- computer interfaces, Brennan (1990a) suggests that common ground is a jointly inhabited “space” in which meaning takes shape through the col- laboration and successive approximations of the participants. Brennan’s work was aimed at designing human-computer interfaces so that they offer means for establishing common ground (“grounding”) that are similar to those that people use in human-to-human conversation, such as interrup- tions, questions, and utterances and gestures that indicate whether some- thing is being understood (Brennan 1990b).

> The notion of interface metaphors was introduced to provide a concep- tual scheme for people that would guard against such misunderstandings by deploying familiar objects and environments as stakes in the common ground: the anchoring expectations. The most famous of these is the desk- top metaphor, first developed by Alan Kay at Xerox PARC in 1970, borrow- ing from some of the work of Douglas Engelbart at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in the 1960s. The Xerox Alto (1973) was the first computer that used the desktop metaphor and a graphical user interface (GUI), fol- lowed in 1981 by the Xerox Star workstation and the Apple Lisa in 1983. The first broad exposure of the desktop metaphor was in 1984 with the in- troduction of the Apple Macintosh, intended as a computer for the general public rather than for business use. It employed graphical icons to repre- sent individual files as “documents” and hierarchical organizational units as “folders.” Rumors of the death of the desktop have been highly exag- gerated. Although it has sprouted many non-desktop affordances over the years (e.g., scroll bars and docks), we can still see its fundamental out- lines in contemporary personal computers as well as in the arrangement of icons and what they mean on smartphones.

The more I think about it the more I think how genius the desktop metaphor is. I do wonder if it's fundamentally limiting, but i'm not convinced it is or that it's going away...

> mediators whose labels may be somewhat less arcane (but possibly more ambiguous) than a computer scientist’s jargon.

> With the advent of the World Wide Web, we began to speak of a Web page as if it were a page in an enormous book. When things turned out to be a little more complicated, with hyperlinks both within and without, ==the terrain of the Web was re-visualized in terms of geography with Web sites==. The notion of the Web portal was based on the idea that a wise provider would open a view of the Web that would pro- tect us from chaos and provide uniform representations of information, but which might well lob us into sites and pages with diverse characteristics and an unexpected entrance into the Wild Wild Web, or else, if we wanted to stay safe, we could choose to remain penned up in walled gardens.

This is a fascinating dichotomy to me. Also love the idea of a "geography" of the web, mapping physical sciences onto networked systems ^b7483c

> Names also change as technology and design advance. In the 1940s, for instance, some people had “car phones” that worked with radio technol- ogy. With the development of a reliable cellular system, we had handheld mobile devices that we called “cell phones.” When mobile phones began to have something like a browser, some “apps,” and messaging capabilities, we began to call them “smart phones.” These phone names are not so much driven by metaphor as by somewhat naïve understandings of technology.

> e see terms like “notebook” and “tablet” used to describe computers with certain dimensions and capa- bilities

> A behavioral metaphor that has been rather more successful and perva- sive is the notion of direct manipulation (discussed in more depth ahead), in which users can move objects about the screen in much the same way as they might in the physical world. Although the operations and conventions implicit in direct manipulation interfaces require more procedural learning than actually picking something up, the value of the metaphor is strong enough to boost most people up the learning curve.

again, see rizwan's experiments with giving windows a physical "weight" to them

[[Resist using the term user in computing contexts, after Laurel (L.202203192215)]]

This also makes me think about a question ↯: how can we think about designing interfaces/experiences that put _care_ at the center?

Computers were originally people. “Computer” was a title that described those people— mostly women—whose job it was to “perform the repetitive calculations required to compute such things as navigational tables, tide charts, and planetary positions for astronomical almanacs” (Kopplin 2010).
