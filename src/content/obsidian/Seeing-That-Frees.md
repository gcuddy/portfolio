## Highlights

Instead of being caught up in a thicket of metaphysical views and opinions, the basic criterion here is, ‘Does it help to free the mind?’

**Note:** Goldstein foreword


It is also mainly through practice that the fullness of the intimate connection between emptiness and dependent arising is understood. Guides to exploring the subtleties and nuances of practice and of insight as they deepen may therefore offer something useful.

**Note:** The only way to grasp the nature of emptiness is through contemplative __practice__, not just theory.


==Revered in the tradition as the ‘crown jewels’ of the Dharma, the Buddha’s teachings on emptiness and dependent arising point and pave the way to the most beautiful possibilities for us as human beings.== Their realization brings a truly radical revolution in our whole sense of existence in a way that opens up a profound and extraordinary freedom.


Emptiness – in Pali, suññatā, in Sanskrit, śūnyatā, which may also be translated as ‘voidness’ – is deep and subtle, however, not easy to see or explain, and in many respects it is even counter-intuitive. It is extremely rare for a full realization to come suddenly. Almost always a journey of understanding is required, one that liberates gradually. And this remarkable adventure of insight involves many facets of our being, certainly not just our intellects.


Without a certain depth of meditation, voidness and all that it means, and also in fact a good portion of what the Buddha taught, cannot be fully understood, even on an intellectual level.


Voidness, the roots of suffering, and the way things seem to be

**Note:** Heading


To many people, and often even to meditators, the very word ‘emptiness’ can evoke emotional associations with a sense of barrenness, bleakness, meaninglessness, or even depression. But that is definitely not what Buddhist teachings mean by the word emptiness. On the contrary, they point to this realization as something wonderful, supremely joyful, and profoundly liberating.


It might also be imagined that voidness is some kind of thing that can be obtained; but it is not a thing. Nor is it a state of mind or a state of consciousness.


Why do we crave? And the answer the Buddha gave and wanted us to understand is that craving is based on a fundamental mistake in the way we see and intuitively sense our selves and the whole world of inner and outer phenomena.


We feel that a thing has an inherent existence – that its existence, its being, inheres in itself alone. Believing then that this real self can really gain or lose real things or experiences which have real qualities, grasping and aversion, and thus dukkha, arise inevitably.

**Note:** First noble truth: life has suffering (dukkha). Second: this is because of craving.


We can, at least for now, define emptiness as the absence of this inherent existence that things appear to naturally and undeniably have.


things. To illustrate this and begin to get a hint of what it means we could consider a wooden chair thrown onto a big fire. The chair begins to burn, then gradually deform and fall apart, slowly turning to ashes. At what point exactly is it no longer a chair? Is it not the mind perceiving and conceiving of it one way or another that determines whether it is ‘a chair’ at a certain moment in time after catching fire? Its chair-ness is given by the mind, and does not reside in it independently of the mind. The lack of an inherently existing ‘official’ time when it stops ‘being a chair’ points to a certain emptiness, its lack of inherent chair-ness.


All things seem to us to be, in the most basic way, simply and exactly ‘what they are’, regardless of how, or whether, they are perceived. Their that-ness and their inherent existence seem evident and given immediately with our very awareness of them; they are not somehow added conceptually later. And yet this seemingly real nature that we perceive is fabricated by the mind.


As Nāgārjuna stated in his Mūlamadhyamakakārikā: The world has no own-nature.3 And in his Acintyastava, a hymn of praise to the Buddha: You taught that the whole world is empty of reality.


The Buddha taught that all phenomena are empty of essence, of inherent existence.


This mistaken seeing is the deepest level of what the Buddha calls the ignorance or fundamental delusion (Skt: avidya; Pali: avijjā) that we share as sentient beings. We cling, and so suffer, because of the way we see. Although it may not be obvious at first, any clinging whatsoever requires this mistaken intuitive sense – of the reality of what we are clinging to, and of the self as something real and so ‘invested in’ through clinging.


Thus when, with insight and wisdom, we realize that something is illusory in some sense, we let go of any clinging to it – of chasing it, trying to hold onto it, or trying to get rid of it. Since clinging brings dukkha, in this release of the clinging there comes release and freedom from dukkha. As the Buddha said, One who… knows with regard to the world that ‘all this is unreal’ abandons the near shore and the far, like a snake its worn-out old skin.


To the degree, depth, and comprehensiveness that we can realize the emptiness, the illusory nature, of phenomena, to that degree, depth, and comprehensiveness is freedom then available to us.


To say that something is empty is to say something much deeper and more radical, harder to fathom, than that things are inconstant, in flux, in process, or even that, inspected more closely, phenomena are seen to be arising and passing with breathtaking rapidity and that we construct a solidity of continuity where in reality there is none.


This teaching is certainly not, for instance, proclaiming that only material things really exist – organisms and neurons and tiny solid atoms or subatomic particles that form the building blocks of our selves and our world. By declaring that, like all other phenomena, these too are equally empty of inherent existence, it goes well beyond that kind of reductionist materialism, which is probably the dominant cultural view in the modern West.


To say that all things are void, however, is not to say that they don’t exist at all. Emptiness is not nihilism. Clearly and undeniably there are appearances of things and those appearances follow reliable laws and function in terms of predictable cause and effect. It turns out, rather, that to see that something is empty is to see that it is beyond the categories of ‘existing’ or ‘not existing’.


The voidness of things is the ‘Middle Way’11 between the assumptions of existence and non-existence, being and non-being, and it is this that needs to be understood.


Generally speaking, and although it may at first seem paradoxical, as we travel this meditative journey into emptiness we find that the more we taste the voidness of all things, the more loving-kindness, compassion, generosity, and deep care for the world open naturally as a consequence in the heart.


We uncover a dimension of wonder in things that we hadn’t known before, because the voidness of things is something truly magical when experienced deeply.


Nāgārjuna wrote: Emptiness is just this dependent arising.


It is this dependence of all phenomena on the mind that is most significant and that needs to be understood.


The world of inner and outer phenomena is, in some very important sense, ‘fabricated’, ‘fashioned’, ‘constructed’ by the mind, so that it is somehow illusory, not real in the way that we assume, and not independent of the mind that fabricates it.


Emptiness definitely challenges the common-sense assumptions we have of things. And typically we have all kinds of assumptions we do not even realize we have. In relation to one of them in particular, it is vital at this point to say something important about our method. If we are not careful, we may simply assume a common default position – happily admitting that some experiences and phenomena are somehow fabricated (illusory), while tacitly, or even more explicitly, presuming others to be true (not fabricated, not illusory). As the modus operandi of our ongoing investigations, though, we will keep open the question of what is and what isn’t fabricated, and simply keep deepening our ability to expose the fabricated nature of more and more phenomena as far as possible.


As the Buddha discovered, not only appearances, but the ‘whole show’ is fabricated, including the mind with its various factors and its consciousness. Thus he also declared the illusory nature of any and all awareness, any consciousness6 of anything.


even this profound realization of the fabricated nature of all phenomena is only a relative truth. Fabrication itself is empty too. Ultimately, it turns out we cannot say that things are fabricated, nor that they are not fabricated. We cannot even say that they arise and cease, nor that they do not arise and cease. What we come to understand is that the way things truly are is beautifully beyond the capacities of our conception. Practising with dependent arising forms a thread, though, that can be followed to such great depths. For in doing so, insights of greater and greater profundity are progressively opened, until this thread ultimately dissolves even itself.


The self is empty. So too is the body, and the whole material world, together with its constituent elements, its subatomic particles, fields, and forces. Also all our inner experiences, emotions, and thoughts; and even whatever experiences we might have through ‘bare attention’ that so much seem as if they are ‘direct experiences’ of ‘things as they are’ – indeed, whatever is perceived, as the Buddha said, is empty.


Void as well are whatever might be conceived as the functional ‘processes’ of the body and of the mind; the ‘flow’ of impermanent events and experiences, inner and outer; the infinite web of conditions that support all things; and the process of fabrication too. Even such apparently obvious and undeniable givens that seem to form the very foundations of existence – space, time (and not just the past and the future, but also the present, ‘the Now’), and awareness, however it is conceived or experienced – these too are empty; Buddha Nature, and whatever notions or senses we may have of ‘Being’ or ‘Essence’; emptiness itself, and even the Unfabricated – all are thoroughly void, in some deep sense illusory.


Even after hearing that emptiness does not mean nihilism, some may still worry that, going deeply into these practices, their life will somehow become cold, loveless, or bleak, or that a sense of meaninglessness will pervade existence. “If I do eventually see there’s no self, that nothing’s real, won’t I then feel that there’s no point to anything?” Here it is vitally important not to jump to imagining what some endpoint of practice will look like, but rather to proceed gradually with whatever letting go you can actually feel, in your own practice, through seeing an emptiness that’s accessible to you right now.


I have found, in my own practice and through teaching, that the realization of emptiness deepens and brings more felt fruits in life if it is approached not only gradually, but also primarily in relation to whatever is immediate in our experience, including, and even especially, any dukkha that may be present in the moment – these sensations, this emotion, these thoughts, and also this physical pain, this heartache, this contracted self-view – learning to see their emptiness, and then deepening and widening the range of experienced phenomena we can recognize to be empty.


Very often a large part of what underlies the proliferation of self-doubt in relation to practice is that we have not yet discovered ways of working in meditation that we can really feel for ourselves are helpful. With experimentation we can find out; and once we do, self-doubt begins to melt as confidence slowly develops.


We might emphasize too the importance of kindness in meditation in general. And in particular, the gradually transformative and inexorable healing power that comes through devotion to regular loving-kindness (mettā) practice should not be underestimated.


For now, let us take as a loose definition of insight: any realization, understanding, or way of seeing things that brings, to any degree, a dissolution of, or a decrease in, dukkha.


Nor is insight simply ‘being mindful and watching the show’, without any effect on, or input into, the fabrication or dissolution of the experience of dukkha. Just knowing, for example, that dukkha, grasping, or reactivity is present is hardly ever enough to free us from it even in that moment.


Second, defining insight in this way admits a wide range to its manifestation. It can be present in any situation, or in regard to any experience or phenomenon: gross or extremely subtle, easy to see or more profound, ‘worldly’ or more transcendent.


Third, however, it is important to stress that, as we are defining it here, only what is actually perceivable to a practitioner qualifies as an insight for that practitioner.


Insight, then, may loosely be described as any ‘seeing’ that frees.


In effect then, the primary and unifying principle overarching the whole of the Dharma is the relieving of suffering and dis-ease. Although not immediately obvious, this conception and approach of the Buddha has immensely significant ramifications that we shall repeatedly return to and expand on and that will become more apparent and more fully understood with more practice. It turns out that making the relief of suffering and dis-ease the fundamental thrust and concern of practice is not only the most compassionate and skilful support for the alleviation of dukkha, such an approach also begins to uncover the truth of things in the process. In taking the dissolving of dukkha as our primary investigation, reality is gradually revealed. On the path the Buddha discovered, then, insight, discernment of truth, and freedom from dukkha all unfold together.


That is to say, in relation to phenomena, (s)he will, in some way or other, explicitly or implicitly, be focusing on the actual experience of dukkha (the First Noble Truth), on recognizing what is supporting it (the Second Noble Truth), and on finding ways of seeing, understanding, and relating that enable the experience of its relief to some extent (loosely, the Fourth and Third Truths respectively).


If insight is what frees, then sustaining any insightful way of looking will free, to some extent, in that moment. And it will keep freeing as long as we sustain it. Thus the use and meaning of ‘insight’ in this mode is as a ‘way of looking that frees’. And we might similarly speak of ‘insight ways of looking’.


As we will see, however, with the maturing of insight into dependent arising and fabrication one realizes that this perceived dichotomy between ‘being’ and ‘doing’, though it might at first seem and feel self-evident, is in fact essentially mistaken and based on a false impression. It rests on three basic and connected assumptions: 1.   That there actually is an objective reality that we can and should ‘be with’. 2.   That anything other than the awareness ‘simply knowing’ or innocently, naturally ‘receiving’ this ‘reality’ is somehow a laboured and artificially constructed state. 3.   That since a state of ‘being’ is thus assumed to be a state of ‘non-doing’ and so to involve no effort, self will not be constructed there. This is in contrast to states more obviously involving intention, which are assumed to construct self.


Sooner or later we come to realize that perhaps the most fundamental, and most fundamentally important, fact about any experience is that it depends on the way of looking. That is to say, it is empty.


We could say that the way of looking in any moment is constructed from the total mix of assumptions, conceptions, reactions, and inclinations, gross and subtle, conscious and unconscious, that are present at that time.


Now crucially, in any moment we are either engaging a way of looking at experience, self, and the world, that is creating, perpetuating, or compounding dukkha to some degree, or we are looking in a way that, to some degree, frees. Unfortunately, we mostly have a habit of looking at experience and phenomena in ways that tend to contribute to dukkha, not to its release and the unbinding of ourselves and the world.


Meditation thus becomes a journey of experimenting: with freeing ways of looking; and in particular with ways of looking that withdraw, undermine, or dissolve various elements in the mind and heart that contribute to fabrication.


As the journey progresses, we will offer for possible cultivation a whole variety of ways of looking that bring freedom and an unfolding of insight into the voidness of things. They might, broadly speaking, be initially divided into two groups, according to how insight into emptiness is arrived at.


1. A gradually deepening inquiry into fabrication – of the self and of all experience


I realize that how things appear always depends on how I look. And I realize too, moreover, that I cannot find or arrive at a way of looking that reveals how a thing really is in itself. Inquiring further into how appearances arise dependently, we begin to understand more exactly why ‘this’ appears and not ‘that’, and why things appear the way they do right now.


More than this though, as mentioned we can gradually develop ways of looking that fabricate, in this very moment, less and less dukkha.


Not to try and stay forever in some kind of unconstructed state, as if that were even possible, but to understand something wondrous about all experience in a way that fundamentally frees our whole sense of existence.


2. Realizing the impossibility of inherent existence


In these kinds of practices, the way of looking hunts for, and then exposes the lack of, inherent existence in one or all phenomena. It then works to sustain the view of that lack, that emptiness, as it continues to regard that phenomenon or all phenomena.


This second group of approaches involve the use of logic and analysis in meditation.


And although without much questioning we might easily have assumed that it is unfeasible, we discover that, approached in certain ways, we can in fact use the logic of the conceptual mind to transcend the conceptual mind.


In addition to these two more formal groups of approaches, it is important to mention a third. For it is very possible at times that something in the heart and mind – we could call it intuitive wisdom – feels the intimations of a different sense of things, intuits somehow and to some degree the truth of emptiness.


It is vital to trust these openings and intimations. However, they are invariably incomplete and need the support of the practices in the other two approaches to refine, deepen, widen, and consolidate the insights they bring.


Vital to our path and of uncountable benefit is the quality of samādhi. This word samādhi is usually translated as ‘concentration’, but in many respects that does not convey the fullness, or the beauty, of what it really means. Therefore we shall keep it in the original language throughout this book. For samādhi involves more than just holding the attention fixed on an object with a minimum of wavering. And it certainly does not necessarily imply a spatially narrowed focus of the mind on a small area. Instead here we will emphasize that ==what characterizes states of samādhi is some degree of **collectedness and unification of mind and body in a sense of well-being**==. Included in any such state will also be some degree of ==**harmonization of the internal energies** of the mind and body==.


In this book we will embrace in our meaning of samādhi both states that have arisen through holding the attention on one object, as well as those that have arisen through insight ways of looking. And we will also include both states where the attention is more narrowly focused on one object, and those where the awareness is more open.


And although, as the Buddha did, we can certainly delineate a range of discrete states of samādhi (the jhānas), in this present context let us rather view it mostly as a continuum: of depth of meditation, of well-being, of non-entanglement, and of refinement of consciousness.


Instead of relating to samādhi practice in terms of measurement or achievement of some goal, it is usually much more helpful, more kind, and less self-alienating to conceive of it as a ==caring, both in the present and in the long term, for the heart and mind==.


I. THE BLESSINGS OF SAMĀDHI


In his teachings, the Buddha did not seem to be overly concerned with the possibility of attachment to ==samādhi==. Rather, he placed great emphasis on its development and the well-being it brings as an important element of the integrated path of practice that he taught, proclaiming, for example: ==This kind of pleasure should be pursued, it should be developed, it should be cultivated; it should not be feared==.


The place, however, of samādhi on the path, and in relation to insight, is not simply a matter of it ‘sharpening’ the mind so that phenomena can be seen more clearly and minutely. Insight, as we have already said and shall extensively explore, is not really about seeing smaller and smaller divisions of ‘reality’. Rather, it ==must primarily address and open our understanding of emptiness, fabrication, and dependent arising==.


==Among its many benefits, a dedication to **samādhi can bring a certain ‘juiciness’ to practice and to life, and this can provide a vital resource of wholesome and profound nourishment**==. In particular, the well-being that it includes can be crucial.


If, however, we can have access to, and develop, a ==reservoir of **profound inner well-being**==, it makes letting go of what is not so helpful much easier. We feel that we have enough, so letting go is not so scary.


Over the long term, ==repeated and regular immersion in such well-being supports the emergence of a steadiness of genuine confidence==. We come to know, beyond doubt, that ==happiness is possible for us in this life==. And because this deep happiness we are experiencing is originating from within us, we begin to feel less vulnerable to and dependent on the uncertainties of changing external conditions.


We could in fact list a whole host of potential blessings that samādhi can bring which likewise overflow from practice well beyond the meditation session or retreat. ==Deep rest and rejuvenation of the whole being, emotional (and, at times, physical) healing, vitality, openings of the intuition, emotional strength that is yet pliable, increase in the heart’s== capacity and in our availabilities to others, steadiness of energy and of commitment in creative and service work – these, and more, are part of the broad range of long-term benefits that samādhi can make available to the whole of one’s life.


In the kinds of insight practices we will be exploring, there are, moreover, a number of qualities it brings to the citta (the heart/mind) that are particularly valuable, almost indispensable. One we have already acknowledged, and most obvious, is the possibility for a more stable focusing of the mind on what we choose to focus on. Periods of some steadiness of attention are necessary for looking deeply and seeing clearly.


First, as the Buddha pointed out, a mind that has cultivated some samādhi has more malleability. It is more able to look at things in different ways, finds it much easier to learn and develop novel approaches and practices, and can move between these with more agility.


Second, the spectrum of deepening samādhi is also a spectrum of deepening refinement of consciousness. As it develops, therefore, samādhi also enables us to see and work with much more subtle levels of fabrication and dependent arising.


Third, the sense of well-being of the body and the mind that samādhi, to some degree, involves has other fruits in addition to those already mentioned. As it progresses, the feelings of bliss, happiness, contentment, and peace, of stillness, spaciousness, and freedom that come and go can be exquisite and profound.


Far from being merely an indulgence, the exposure to, immersion in, and accessibility of these feelings provides the citta with a sort of ‘cushioning’ that is usually crucial as the insight practice deepens.


It can be quite common for a practitioner engaged in powerful insight practices to find, for instance, that the body starts jerking slightly in an unhelpful way at moments of deep insight. This is often easily remedied by accessing, and then inviting in, some of the softening qualities available in deeper states of samādhi.


First: as we have already mentioned, most often, insights need repeating to be absorbed. Second: we need to use insights that we have had. We need, at least at times, to act and make decisions in life informed by their perspectives. This consolidates and empowers them greatly.


Third, and in relation to samādhi: since the soil of the citta that is cultivating samādhi is more well-turned and full of nutrients, the insights that we have tend to be planted deeper in the being and stay alive for longer.


II. A WISE RELATIONSHIP TO SAMĀDHI PRACTICE


When we invest time and effort working patiently on samādhi, more is happening than we might immediately recognize. Too easily we can become caught up in measuring the ups and downs of our focus of mind and miss the bigger picture of what we are cultivating. ==For even before the arising of any well-being or much steadiness of attention, beautiful and always helpful qualities are being strengthened and developed: patience, perseverance, and mindfulness, for example, as well as the kind of ‘muscle’ or power of mind that gradually accrues on returning over and over to our meditation theme.== Hopefully too we are cultivating kindness in our attitude to our mind, and also gently erasing the habit of judging ourselves.


Consciously acknowledging and reminding yourself of this bigger picture of what is being nourished before a formal meditation session, and as you work on samādhi, can be very helpful in keeping the citta buoyant and inspired, and in preventing the tightness or dryness that comes when the view of practice is contracted in any way.


The process is aided more by our taking care of a certain degree of well-being that can then serve as a foundation for samādhi to develop. Thus, whether on or off retreat, it can be immensely helpful to give some attention to nurturing, just as much as possible, the kinds of elements that contribute to a climate supportive for the ongoing deepening of samādhi practice. Qualities such as: •   inner and outer kindness •   some simplicity •   a degree of receptivity, connection, and openness to beauty and also to nature •   a love of the Dharma •   appreciation and gratitude for whatever and whoever is around you and supporting your practice


Allowing and encouraging a quality of play and experimentation in practice is vital, and vitalizing. I can’t emphasize this enough. Usually that’s how we learn best as human beings, and it keeps things from getting rigid and feeling heavy.


Central to the progress of practice, and particularly of samādhi, is our whole relationship with ‘the five hindrances’ – sense desire, ill-will or aversion, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and worry, and doubt.


It is a practice to learn not to take the hindrances personally, to let go of any self-evaluation that we might tend to attach to their arising, and to remind ourselves that all their presence means is that we are human beings still. (The Buddha stated that they do not disappear permanently until full Awakening.)


The mind gets hooked into and entangled in the stories that the hindrances tend to drag up or spin, and easily becomes ensnared in the web of unhelpful proliferation (papañca) thus woven. Over time though, we learn to recognize the wily ways of the hindrances and need not be taken for a ride to such an extent. We understand what is happening, and buy into their perspectives much less.


For hindrances do not just arise in formal meditation; they are states that impact our life and our well-being every day. And if we can maintain a stance that, no matter what the conditions, asks always, “What can I learn here?”, the times of hindrances in samādhi practice can be as genuinely valuable as the times that feel good.


III. A FEW MORE SUBTLE POINTS ABOUT SAMĀDHI PRACTICE


A state of samādhi is essentially a state of energized calm. In meditation, we are working, therefore, to support some fluid balance of both energy (or vitality) and calmness.6 Although it might feel relatively pleasant, too much calmness without enough energy is a kind of subtly dull state, sometimes referred to as ‘sinking’. The mind and the body can feel slightly heavy when this is the case and the quality of brightness is not so manifest in the mind. On the other hand, too much energy without the calm to balance it can create a subtle form of restlessness, often referred to as ‘drifting’.


For practitioners who already have a little experience in meditation, probably the most common difficulty and the biggest hurdle encountered in trying to develop samādhi is the feeling of tightness that can arise at times, both emotionally and physically. Indeed it is often a recurring experience of tightness that causes a person to despair and give up samādhi practice in favour of another kind of approach – usually of ‘just letting things be’. In order that the practice of samādhi can flourish then, we need to find ways to address such tightening.


To begin with it must be pointed out that an essential aspect of the larger sensitivity and awareness that is included in mature practice is an awareness of the subtle emotional relationship with the practice at any moment in time. Incorporating this delicate and ongoing wider ‘monitoring’ of our attitude and feeling, we are more likely to notice sooner when tightness creeps in, and there is then the possibility of responding skilfully to it.


First: Tightness is a state of contraction of the mind and body energy. So too, in fact, is any restlessness – gross or subtle (as in drifting) – and any dullness or drowsiness (including sinking). It can be very helpful, therefore, when any of these are present in samādhi practice, to find ways of opening up more space for the awareness, without abandoning the primary object.


Awareness of the whole body is one way this can be effected. Even if you are working with a method of breath meditation, for example, that involves a spatially narrow focus of attention as ‘foreground’, it is often beneficial to lightly maintain, as the ‘background’ to this ‘foreground’, a global awareness permeating fully and ‘filling out’ the whole body in an alive way.


Second: Tightness is usually a result of, and indicates, slightly too much effort in the concentration at that time. Similarly, a slight over-efforting can underlie both sinking and drifting.


In any case, it is necessary to gradually learn to include in our awareness a sensitivity to our moment-to-moment level and quality of effort.


Part of the refinement, and beauty too, of this art of samādhi practice is the moment-to-moment play of sensitivity and responsiveness as conditions change. Without this, like a stationary and unresponsive surfer, it’s just not much fun, and we simply get thrown off balance even by the gentlest waves.


What can help greatly in developing this subtler sensitivity to effort levels is, again, an awareness of the whole body and how it feels. Even a slight over-efforting the body will reveal, through tension or tightness somewhere in particular, or through a subtle sense of contraction of the space of the whole body. Relaxing the body in those moments can be helpful, helping organically to relax the effort in turn.


We can actually use the feeling of tightness when it appears somewhere in the body as a helpful signal to slightly back off the effort in that moment. And this subtle backing off, this delicacy of application of effort, we can learn to play with, much as one might learn to control a manual car with the clutch and accelerator pedals.


Modes of Attention


Probing and receiving


For example, in breath meditation one way of working is with the attention concentrated on a small area of sensation somewhere in the body: at the upper lip, the nostrils, or somewhere in the abdomen are common points of concentration. The attention can work in a way where it ‘moves toward’ that point and probes it, penetrating that small area of sensation, like an arrow or a laser beam. Alternatively, at other times, it can be more useful to encourage a more ‘receptive’ mode of working, to let the awareness ‘receive’ the breath sensations. Here the breath may be conceived of, and thus perceived, as ‘coming toward’ the awareness, as opposed to the other way around.


Rather than being separate modes, these two constitute more the poles of a spectrum. Within this larger range, it can be very helpful to experiment with different stances of the attention.


Playing with the intensity of attention


Related to this, we can also discover a continuum of what could be called the ‘intensity’ of the attention. And this too is a quality whose modulations we can grow sensitive to and control.


Sensitive to the whole body


In contrast to a concentration of the attention on a small area, another way of working is to focus primarily on the wider field of feeling of the whole body – the felt sense, the ‘texture’, ‘tone’, vibration, and energy of the whole space of the body – and to fill that space with an aliveness of awareness, of presence, that permeates the entire body.


Of course, many times we will find on inspection that there is a mixture of both pleasant and unpleasant ‘frequencies’, or a range of qualities, coexisting in the tone and vibration of the body space. With practice we can learn, if we wish, to tune into whichever of these frequencies we choose. Attuning to and enjoying the more pleasant frequencies in the mix is an immensely helpful skill to learn and very valuable in fostering samādhi.


Working with Feelings of Pleasure and with the Subtle Body


Encouraging feelings of well-being


is also possible to use the breath or the mettā to help elicit and support the pervasion of this sense of well-being. Simply sensitizing to, and enjoying, the way we feel the energetic resonances of the mettā or the breath throughout the whole space of the body – opening to and finding delight in their reverberations there – can gently move the experience in the direction of a more expansive well-being.


And when there is a state of agitation or anxiety, we can play with ways of breathing or practising the mettā, and also ways of sensing the breath or mettā, that feel as if they soothe the subtle body and smooth out its energies.


The imagination, too, can be skilfully employed in order to gently encourage this sense of pleasure or well-being in the subtle body. While simultaneously pervading the whole body space with an awareness sensitive to the texture and tone of the energy of that whole field, it is possible, for example, to imagine the subtle body as a body of radiant light; then to open to and explore what that feels like. Any image formed in this way does not necessarily need to appear in precise detail, or even completely distinctly. It is, rather, the energetic sense of pleasure or well-being which it supports that is primary, since this is what primarily supports the samādhi.


Likewise, one may experiment with imagining various luminous lines of energy in the body – for example, between the perineum and the crown of the head, or from the lower belly out through the legs – and sense how any such line of energy supports the whole body to feel upright, open, and energized.


Towards unification


Once it is easily sustaining for some minutes, we can gently begin to take that bodily feeling of well-being as the primary object of our focus. It is important not to ‘snatch at it’, but rather to ease the attention toward it gracefully, and gradually let it take up the full focus of attention. Then the attention and the citta can be encouraged to enjoy it as fully as possible.


Steadiness of feeling is more important than strength


Although the feelings of pleasure might also be very strong at times, this is actually not necessary in order to use them in a helpful way. Over time, their strength will in fact vary naturally (and anyway, as the practice matures, at a certain stage they begin to mellow). What is more necessary is that they sustain relatively steadily for more than a few minutes. Then we can learn to sustain them for longer.


Suffusing and saturating the whole body


Along with the steadiness of the feelings of well-being, and of the attention on those feelings, we are also gently aiming at eventually having the whole space of the body suffused by and saturated with the feeling of well-being or pleasure.


But even if it does not spread then, that need not be regarded as a problem. A vital aspect of the whole relationship with samādhi practice is to enjoy what well-being is there at any time, not to measure it and view it through a lens that somehow demands, even subtly, that it be ‘better’, bigger, stronger.


Having said that, it is in fact also possible at times to gently encourage the feeling of pleasure or well-being to spread – for instance by simply opening up the space of the awareness to embrace a larger area of the body.


There is also, again, no reason why one cannot just imagine the feeling of well-being permeating the body space more fully. The perception then often begins to follow the image.


Unblocking and smoothing out the subtle body energies


The harmonization and unification in well-being that is characteristic of samādhi can also be regarded as a harmonization, alignment, smoothing out, and opening of the flows of energies in the subtle body. All day and all night long our energy body is moving in and out of states of alignment and openness, constriction and blockage, in response to a whole range of conditions, physical, mental, and emotional.


When the subtle energies are blocked and agitated, samādhi is to some extent blocked. And when the subtle energy is unblocked and unagitated, samādhi is not so far away.


it can be useful to learn means of gently unblocking the energies when there is any sense of energetic constriction, in order to open up again the potential of a degree of samādhi at that time. Again, with a light and playful attitude of experimentation, a variety of ways of working in meditation can be discovered.


IV. THE RELATION BETWEEN SAMĀDHI AND INSIGHT


Insight brings samādhi


Mindful observation will reveal that any craving or clinging is always accompanied by, and reflected in, blocks and knots in the subtle body.


insight is any way of looking that releases craving. As the insight and emptiness practices are developed, therefore, they can also be used at times to deliberately undo the craving that is mirrored in the knots in the energy body.


We may need some insight to help us let go of some craving or clinging, perhaps even a craving we were unaware of, and then some samādhi becomes possible.


Relaxing craving through insight will therefore allow the mind to settle more naturally and easefully into stillness and a steadiness of attention. We can see then that the quality of steadiness of attention does not only come through holding the mind to one object.


A fluid balance between samādhi and insight


This in turn suggests the possibility of ways of working in meditation where insight and samādhi practices can fluidly and openly complement each other. If desired, their developments can proceed in parallel.


It is the balance of samādhi and insight work that is important and so potentially powerful.


If you are practising with this book at home off retreat, you will probably find many times, perhaps unexpectedly, that tipping the balance of your practice towards samādhi in any sitting, even by as much as a ratio of five to one, greatly increases the efficacy and the felt depth of the insight practice that you are doing.


If you are practising with this book on retreat, after a few days devoted to samādhi at the beginning of your retreat, I would highly recommend then adopting a loose and fluid, roughly equal, balance between insight practices on the one hand, and samādhi practice (whether through the breath, mettā, body awareness, or whatever) on the other, in any rhythms through the day that feel beneficial and supportive.


Samādhi and fabrication


It typically takes a good deal of both samādhi practice and insight to reverse a misconception of what is actually happening in a state of ‘concentration’. For at first it understandably seems that such an altered state of unification and well-being is arrived at by ignoring phenomena other than the chosen object, so that these other phenomena, both inner and outer, are repressed from the consciousness at that time. It might seem too that, replacing them in their absence, with much ‘huffing and puffing’ and strenuous effort, an altered pleasant state is constructed.


Is that really what is happening though? A state of samādhi is indeed still a constructed, fabricated state. But keen investigation, reflection, and a pondering of the relationship it has with letting go suggest that it may be more accurate to understand samādhi as a spectrum of states that involve progressively less fabrication than a more ‘ordinary’ state of consciousness involves.


Therefore any state of samādhi is a state of less fabricating, less building of the perception and sense of the self and of the world. If we understand how to contemplate it, samādhi itself offers profound insights into fabrication and dependent arising.


Risks of Attachment


Without experience of different states of samādhi, there is not only more chance that states arisen through insight meditation may, through unfamiliarity or fear, be fled from or not given the chance to settle; it is also in fact much more likely that attachment crystallizes around states of insight and particularly around the views and perceptions they involve or imply.


Attachment to the pleasure of samādhi usually only occurs if experiences of samādhi are rare. A meditator may then hanker after it unskilfully because, even if they are told they shouldn’t, and even if they know it is impermanent, they do not have the confidence that such pleasure, though not permanent, is regularly accessible.


as the samādhi develops through different stages, even the bliss of pīti is easily let go of as the more fulfilling sukkha (happiness) becomes more available. And most of the clinging to this is released in turn as the even more satisfying and exquisite ensuing stage of peacefulness opens up. Likewise much of the clinging to states of peacefulness may be released as the beauty and greater subtlety of a deeper stillness and equanimity establishes itself. And so it can go, the process almost refining itself, until we are no longer attached to states of pleasure.


A second possible way of becoming attached to samādhi is through pride – believing that we are somehow special because we can experience, even at will, such states of bliss and peace.


It is not the ‘self’ that does and ‘achieves’ it. When the necessary conditions are present, samādhi arises and can sustain; when they are not there, it does not.


The third and, as mentioned, most insidious way that meditation can provide an object of attachment pertains as much to states of insight meditation as it does to states of samādhi. For there can easily arise attachment to the view opened up or implied through any state or insight.


On the meditative journey, special care in this regard needs to be taken with a number of wonderful, deeper states of consciousness that can be arrived at both through insight practices as well as through ‘concentration’. These include the four arūpa (formless) jhānas – the spheres of infinite space, of infinite consciousness, of nothingness, and of neither perception nor non-perception – and also states that are similar to these jhānas, but which involve, relative to their jhānic counterparts, more of an openness of the sense doors, more consciousness of the diverse phenomena arising and passing in the space of awareness.


Especially when supported by a devotion to cultivating samādhi, the meditation practices that reveal just how experience is fabricated are immensely powerful. So too are those practices that expose the impossibility of any thing’s inherent existence. When developed, such practices are capable of cutting through the reifications of avijjā at the deepest levels and with respect to all things. All possible notions of self and all phenomena can thus be seen to be empty, including even those which seem to be the most fundamental givens of existence – awareness, space, time and the present moment, for instance – where subtle reification is usually unrecognized and unquestioningly entrenched.


But there are many situations in life where a significant degree of dukkha can be released through recognizing voidnesses that are not so hard to see at all. Through just a small shift in, or refinement of, our way of looking we realize that some element or other involved is a fabrication, and that it has no inherent existence.


We start our insight investigations with these more modest shifts of the way of looking – not only because there is a great deal of suffering that can be relieved at this level, but also because, in the means by which they deconstruct the views underpinning dukkha, some of these ways of looking actually form the humble beginnings of a number of the deeper and more powerful ways of looking that we will learn to cultivate.


Social Conventions


The whole area of social conventions is one in which we can experience all kinds of suffering. Yet often with just a little reflection we can recognize the emptiness of some convention that we have reified, and this realization can bring some freedom.


It is quite easy to see that countries, for instance, do not have the kind of inherent existence that we as a species seem so readily to believe and feel they have. A country only exists because of human agreement; it is a human convention.


Of course, a group of people in one area coming together and deciding to create a framework to support their collective well-being is not in itself a problem. It will probably be helpful in fact. But when the patently fabricated nature of countries is not recognized, the concept of ‘this country’, or ‘my country’, can gain an overwhelming force and solidity in human minds. The belief in the country as something real can give rise to a strength and rigidity of feeling beyond even the biological impulse for survival. How much violence and suffering in human history has there been with roots in this reification? How much willingness to kill and to die dependent on such a belief?


The relatively obvious insights proffered above also make clear that there is no a priori reason a country’s boundaries need to be positioned where they currently are.


Extending this a little, however, we can see that, regardless of where exactly the borders are at present drawn, the very notion of any particular country necessarily exists in relation to the notion of what is ‘not this country’.


Any concept of ‘this country’ thus arises together with, and dependent on, a concept of ‘those countries’. Though it might seem to, no country exists independently of other countries; none has inherent existence.


Although not always easy to recognize, it is important to acknowledge too how often our opinions and our feelings about many things are conditioned by the views prevalent in the society we live in. Particularly significant in this regard is the conditioning of our sense of values, and thus also of our sense of what is valuable.


For ourselves individually, for the continuing welfare of humanity and of other species, and for the well-being of the planet’s ecosystems, the consequences of this kind of conditioning of values are enormous.


Within all this, just one of the reasons such conditioning can cause suffering for us personally is that we can often attach our sense of self-worth to that which is held as valuable by our society.


In this respect, although also in others, the world-views and the value-views in smaller sub-cultures are often similar in their manipulative effects to those of the wider culture. We might consider, as an example, an educational environment that places great emphasis on one certain area of achievement – it could be academic, athletic, musical, or artistic – and frequently attempts to assess children on the basis of certain prescribed abilities in that area. For any child receiving again and again from the authorities ratings that are low relative to other children, it will be hard not to internalize a sense of self-worth dependent on this.


Fifteen thousand years ago, my prowess as a hunter of woolly mammoths would probably have accorded me more status in the culture than my ability to handle the kinds of abstract mathematical concepts involved, for example, in twelfth grade differential calculus. I need to see: one is not inherently more valuable than another; I am not inherently worth more or less dependent on these abilities. If I can see this, I open a door to a more natural sense of self-worth, and to a degree of freedom.


There are probably countless examples, large and small, where it is possible to shake off the shackles of the dominant view and expose a lack of intrinsic truth to some assumption or ideology that may be widely agreed on in our social world. Sometimes the belief in a value system is shattered in an instant of penetrating insight. Other times it is melted away more gradually. Either way, although undoubtedly we do not need meditation to reflect in the kinds of ways described, it does take a certain boldness to trust in one’s own capacity to question views and to think for oneself. And while these qualities of boldness and trust are dependent on and empowered by many factors, let us mention a couple which may actually be supported by a more meditative approach.


The first is including in one’s awareness the sense of strength as it manifests in the body. This sense can often be neglected, especially if we are not accustomed to having faith in ourselves in this way. But noticing, allowing, inhabiting, and even enjoying the bodily feelings that accompany the sense of confidence in our own seeing will greatly help that conviction, self-trust, and strength to take root and flourish in the being.


Connected to this, the second helpful element is a skilful awareness, and holding, of any difficult emotions that are evoked by what is being considered. In order for freedom to be possible, it is vital not to ignore feelings such as anger, hurt, or powerlessness that may be associated with an issue being reflected on. Such emotions may well need caring for, in various ways, as part of the process of liberating the mind. Equally though, it is important not to sink in feelings like these, or to be consistently overwhelmed by them, or pulled down into a state where there is no space or opportunity for creative responses and movements of mind.


Practice: Opening to freedom and strength through reflection

**Note:** Take note of practice


When the mind believes in and builds up certain concepts and their significance for the self, it gives them a solidity they do not possess on their own. Then we can very easily feel burdened and imprisoned in certain situations that involve those concepts.


For some years now I have been the Resident Teacher at Gaia House. Being so visible to so many people so much of the time in a role like that, it would feel quite claustrophobic and burdensome if I were to perceive myself all the time as ‘The Resident Teacher’. Until I am asked to, by someone or by a situation, however, I don’t have to step into that role. And although I could, I need not conceive of myself as ‘The Resident Teacher’ as I am simply walking down the corridor, or reading a book, or sitting on the toilet. Even if I tried, I would probably forget at times! If I pay attention, I see there are countless such ‘holes’ – moments and stretches in any day when I am not, and do not have to be, ‘The Resident Teacher’.


And I can also see that this role is actually only one of the various roles I have in my life at present.


So easily one role gets over-emphasized in an unwise way and we contract around it in identification. It becomes charged for us then, and it may begin to feel like a painful weight. Opening out the seeing to recognize the wider context can open out the contraction, so that vitality, interest, and creativity can flow more freely and widely.


By seeing these gaps, we burst a bubble we’ve believed in and felt constricted by, and reveal a spaciousness in which we can then move more freely.


Focusing too much on the perceived differences between ‘being on retreat’ and ‘everyday life’, we might feel either imprisoned in the form – the structure, schedule, and way of being – on a retreat, or become attached to that form and then have trouble letting it go and leaving at the end. Usually we do not realize, however, that the perceptions of certain differences are being fabricated, and inflated, by the mind and its tendencies of attention.


Investigating more closely, I recognize that my ‘world’, wherever I am, wherever I move to, is a world of inner and outer experiences, that is to say, appearances – sights, sounds, smells, tastes, bodily sensations, emotions, thoughts, memories, dreams, and intentions.


Viewing through the lens of such deconstruction frees up my sense of things. And I can begin to question whether it is really as different as it seems to be from place to place. Is any environment as solid as it seems? When I look in this way, it is hard to find ‘the retreat’, ‘the work-place’, ‘the vacation’, ‘the travelling to’, or any situation I may find myself clinging to or struggling with.


Looking more carefully, I can recognize that meditation does not have the kind of solidity that the mind might be giving it. If I am sitting in a formal meditation session and actually spacing out for a few moments, is that then ‘meditating’ or not ‘meditating’? And conversely, if I am walking down the street in the city and spontaneously, without any effort on my part, strong mindfulness arises for just a few moments, is that ‘meditating’ or not?


Any teaching on emptiness is simply a tool for freedom; that is all. When we have reified something in a way that causes dukkha, we can pick up these tools as ways of looking that deconstruct the reification and the solidification, and thereby bring a sense of relief, unburdening, spaciousness, and freedom. But like any tool that we have picked up and used, we can also put it down again.


More conventional ways of looking have their validity, their place and their necessity, and their beauty too. Relating to a period of retreat as a sacred space very different from ‘normal life’ may be profoundly helpful and skilful – for example in supporting some sense of meaningful devotion.


It is worth reiterating that experimentation is vital in all this, as it is in all practice. We need to notice what the effects are of different ways of looking, what is being supported. And when we feel that a way of looking brings some freedom, openness, or other wholesome and helpful quality, we know that we can trust it.


While it is certainly possible that merely reflecting on a situation to acknowledge the ‘holes’ and deconstruct differences may be helpful, actually seeing and experiencing things in these ways will be much more powerfully liberating.

Practice: Investigating what is being fabricated through the hindrances

About all this, for now, we simply want to point out that it can be very helpful, when the awareness is unwisely sucked in in this way, to pay attention deliberately to a sense of space. Noticing space opens up the perception, and can begin to dissolve the vicious circle.

**Note:** Pic. Creating sense of spaciousness inside body allows for body to feel grounded and create space for emotional discharge.


Practice: Beginning to notice space

**Note:** Note


As we have stated before, space is not emptiness, and emptiness is not a space of any kind. Rather, our investigation here is simply into how the mind gives solidity to experience and fabricates dukkha through the very ways we relate to, see, and conceive of things. We are gradually learning to untangle the tangle of suffering.


7 An Understanding of Mindfulness

[[Staying at Contact as a way to alleviate Dukkha]]

Let us begin by considering two closely related aspects of mindfulness – ‘staying at contact’, and ‘bare attention’ – that contribute to its capacity to bring a degree of freedom through some lessening of fabrication.


‘Staying at Contact’


In any moment, without a certain amount of mindfulness, there can often be a tendency for the attention to get dragged into the associations, reactivity, and stories that a simple stimulus (any sight, sound, smell, taste, body sensation, thought, or emotion, for instance) might trigger for us. This movement, the escalation of such complicating mental activity, and the entanglement of the attention therein, are all ingredients of a grosser level of manifestation of papañca. (For now, papañca may be translated as ‘mental proliferation’.) In contrast, when we practise mindfulness, we are usually trying more to ‘stay at contact’ – that is, to hold or return the attention to the ‘initial, basic’ experiences that arise at the contact of the sense doors with the sense objects.


The word papañca might also be translated as ‘amplification’. And etymologically, it has the implication of ‘spreading out’, ‘extending’ something. As we have briefly described, it is possible to see that this is indeed what happens when the mind becomes ensnared in these associations and stories. It fabricates – constructs, amplifies, and inflates – at that time, both the sense of the self and also the sense of something else, an issue that it is somehow obsessed with and caught up in.


If, at any point, I recognize that I have already been pulled in to a web, or even a tornado, of papañca, it is crucial to realize that all is not lost. There are still many practice options available to me then. In the context of this particular practice of staying at contact, I would simply make an effort to return the attention to the present moment and the actuality of experience at contact with the sense objects.


If we take it as a practice to move through a day, or a period of a day, trying with mindfulness to stay more at contact, we find that it is actually a delightful way of being. Lighter, more easeful, less burdened by the complexities of papañca, we also enjoy the vivid brightness of the present moment, the beauty of ‘nowness’, and the relative spaciousness of less self-building.


Practice: ‘Staying at contact’

**Note:** Note


Experiment with two modes of doing this: a)   With the attention directed (at any time) to a specific sense object – a sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, or body sensation. Make sure that you also include objects that do seem to trigger reactions and associations. b)   With the attention more open to the totality of sense contact.


Intimately connected with this idea of ‘staying at contact’ is the notion of ‘bare attention’. Not only does the mind have a habit of getting pulled off into associations and stories, but also a tendency to overlay a veil of concepts, abstractions, and images ‘on top of’ our ‘basic’ experience.


The mental image of our body, rather than the sensations of the body, is often what the mind is engaging and preoccupied with, for example; and we feel the sensations of the body mixed with and through the filter of this image, instead of more ‘barely’ or ‘purely’. Or, hearing a sound and recognizing a plane, the concept and image of a ‘plane’ can get superimposed onto the sound in a way that makes our listening at that time more vague, less intimately attentive to the actual experience of the sound itself.


Oftentimes, of course, this is harmless. But any veil on our experience will colour and obscure it, and any investigation into experience thus veiled will be similarly coloured and obscured. Along with stories, abstractions and concepts are also implicated in the…


For example, at certain junctures of change and uncertainty, if there is agitation, a person might think, “I’ve no idea what I’m going to do with my life!” Believing this compelling but rather abstract thought, though, anxiety is fed and a vicious circle of reactivity and reification is set up. This is dukkha. What is not seen then is that the…


Thus at times when there is dukkha, it can be helpful to ask oneself if the mind has fallen for some abstraction or other, to see if one can identify what it might be, and then to question whether the perspective of this abstraction is necessarily true. In addition to this possibility, though, the ‘bare attention’ that is often a feature of mindfulness practice seeks…


Consider a practitioner who feels some sensations of pressure and constriction in his chest arising from time to time in meditation. With the best of intentions, he might interpret, perceive, and experience them through a whole heavy apparatus of constructs about his story, his past, and perhaps his difficulties with his parents. In this he may ascribe causality, and sometimes even blame. He is sure there are emotions, memories, and more sensations (all of which are assumed to be difficult or painful) somehow locked inside him. And perhaps he vaguely imagines a lengthy process of ‘releasing’, and thus hopefully ‘healing’. Even without attaching a definite story from the past to such…


Now, it is not that there may not be some truth in these kinds of views. But they are only ways of looking. And as such, they may…


In this last example, an alternative approach to the whole experience would be to practise bare attention. This would mean trying to sustain a way of looking, over and over, moment to moment, that meets and notices, pays careful and close attention to, the sensations in the chest as they present themselves (pressure, heat, tightness, etc.), as much as possible putting aside, just for now, any story or…


First, that our investigations around all this need to be sensitive, and probably delicate. The whole area of emotional healing and emptiness is complex, and it asks of us not only great kindness,…


Second, I am not suggesting that bare attention is always a better, or even a truer, way of looking than some of those that…


Practice: Questioning abstractions and generalizations

**Note:** Note


Practice: Bare attention

**Note:** Note


Often when there is dukkha, we are pulled into trying to combat it at a level of great complexity – ideas and stories and thoughts. Working with things and inquiring at this level is important and necessary too, but sometimes not helpful. Any unskilful attention to unhelpful abstractions will only feed those constructs and the associated reactivity, and thus fabricate more complexity, self, and dukkha in the process.

**Note:** Whenever possible, SIMPLIFY


With bare attention in mindfulness practice we are, in effect, deliberately choosing to pay attention in a simpler way and to a simpler, less conceptual, level of experience. With staying at contact, we are also choosing to keep attention with a simpler object – the immediate sense experiences – so that it does not become so embroiled in complexities in ways that give them energy and cause them to grow. In both modes the mind is taken out of the pathways, or labyrinths, of unhelpful constructions, therefore not feeding those constructions so much in that moment. This can simplify the whole experience, and possibly untie a knot of dukkha. For less is being fabricated then – less self, less issue, and less dukkha. Thus we can say that one way mindfulness often helps is by deploying a simpler attention to a simpler aspect of the complexity of what is happening.


Learning to deliberately bring a kind and skilful attention to the emotions that are present in the body, allowing and holding them, can allow the emotions to soften. The body then begins to soften. As the body and the emotions thus soften, the view, the way of looking, softens naturally, and right then it is possible to see ‘My Life’ in a different way. We realize the perception of ‘My Life’ as this or that was not only a cause of, but also partially dependent on, the knot of emotions. We see the emptiness of the abstraction and the over-solidified perception: things are not really that way. Rather than rendering us irresponsible, however, this seeing frees us to respond more wisely to the situation.


Often what we find when we look, however, is not just one but actually a whole complex of emotions present. What may be possible then is to try, slowly and delicately, to differentiate the various strands of emotions that are there (even if a word can’t be found for each one). Then holding each somewhat more individually in turn, we may give each some attention, or some kindness, or whatever else it may need. The overwhelm that we can experience when emotions, thoughts, stories, and reactions all become entwined can be lightened this way. Clarity, and often some healing too, can be enabled.

**Note:** Essentially “label” each emotion?


Within paying attention to any emotion, we may choose at times to simplify the attention even further – by keeping it focused very specifically on the simple level of the vedanā (pleasant, unpleasant, or neither pleasant nor unpleasant) of the bodily manifestation of that emotion as it is occurring. We could find an area of the body where the moment-to-moment expression of the vedanā feels relatively clear. Then we might gently work to sustain the attention one-pointedly there. It will probably be helpful to play, as discussed in the samādhi chapter, with the balance and intensity of such an attention. It may need to be relatively bright and energized, but also soft and delicate. What will be important too is that, all the while, we are allowing the vedanā to appear as it does – pleasant, or unpleasant, or neither pleasant nor unpleasant – in this moment, and then the next, and the next.


Practice: Choosing a simpler object of attention


When there is an experience of dukkha that seems to involve some complexity, see if it is possible, while remaining connected to the difficult experience and without moving the mind deliberately somewhere else (like the breath or a mettā practice), to tune the mindfulness to some simpler aspect of the totality of that difficult experience – for instance, the emotions, or the vedanā of the emotions in the body. As you sustain the attention on this simpler element, notice what effect this has on the sense of dukkha and on the whole experience. With regard to focusing on the emotions here: We are interested in finding ways of attending to, relating to, or holding the unfolding of an emotion or of the vedanā of an emotion, that feel like they are helping, soothing or calming the formation of the emotion or the fabrications around it. It is vital, therefore, that a portion of the mindfulness be devoted to noticing gently if this is happening, discerning if this way of attending is helpful in this moment.


More than this though, we can begin to get a little sense, at a certain level, of how the perceptions of solidity are fabricated. Just as in those children’s ‘dot-to-dot’ drawing books – where you follow and join the numbered dots with a pencil line to get a picture of something or other – close mindfulness can show that the mind joins the fragmented ‘dots’ of momentary experience, and thus fabricates some ‘bigger’ and more solid-seeming experience. And as explained, the bigger and more solid an experience seems, the greater the clinging and the dukkha it involves. This ‘joining of the dots’ happens in thinking about an impending experience in the future, and also while we are actually experiencing it.


Mindfulness supports the possibility of investigation, and of our asking, in a way, “What is actually so terrible here?” It sees through the construction of a big terrible thing from tiny discrete moments of experience. We realize that the ‘whole’, unwittingly built from such separate and smaller moments, is actually empty, a fabrication.

**Note:** There are always gaps in every experience


Returning again to the earlier example of the generalization of ‘not knowing what I’m going to do with my life’, either a reflective self-questioning or a more steady mindfulness would reveal that there are many moments in the day when there is in fact a ‘knowing what’s next’: “I’m going to have a shower”, or “I’m going to meet my friend for a coffee.” Abstractions and generalizations, like ‘My Life’ and ‘unknown’, are exposed as fabrications partly through such simple realizations – for instance here that there is, in the totality of diverse experiences, both knowing and not knowing; it’s certainly not all unknown. Mindfulness and inquiry support a kind of puncturing of some abstractions in a way that can be calming, opening, and freeing.

**Note:** Indeed, just hearing this is actually calming


Practice: ‘Dot-to-dot’ Experiment with giving a whole range of different kinds of experiences a steadiness of intimate, careful, and precise, moment-to-moment attention. Can you notice the ‘gaps’ in the experience of a ‘thing’? See if you can sustain for some time that level of mindfulness that sees the gaps. What difference does it make then in your sense of that thing? How does it feel to see this way? In your investigations, be sure to include various emotions and mind states, as well as pleasant, unpleasant, and also ‘neutral’ physical experiences involving different sense doors. (Taste, touch, and bodily sensation are particularly conducive to this kind of investigation.)


An important thread running through the discussion of this chapter is worth summarizing: Although it can be useful to think of mindfulness as ‘being with things as they really are’, it is in fact more accurate, and more helpful for our purposes, to understand basic mindfulness practice as a way of looking that merely fabricates a little less than our habitual ways of looking.


One of the ways self becomes exaggeratedly and inflexibly built up is through blame. There a view is solidified, not just of a situation in the past, but of the role of our self, or the self of another, in that situation. And though arising with respect to one specific event, self-blame that we have not seen through can petrify over time into a conclusion about how we, or others, truly are. The blame and the conclusion can become encrusted together, and encrusted into whatever chronically afflictive and rigid mass of more general negative self-views a person might hold. Then, of course, these more pervasively critical self-views make it increasingly likely that the way of seeing self or other in response to some new problematic situation will also be blame. Another vicious cycle of dukkha. Like all such cycles, though, it is open to defusing and dissolution from a number of angles.


Usually in adopting such a stance the mind is adopting a shrunken view. Seeing only in terms of self, and habitually placing self at centre stage of whatever situation or event transpired, it is not recognizing and including in its understanding the wider confluence of conditions that give rise to anything at all in the world. But seeing in terms of the wider web of conditions that come together to give rise to any action or result is a different, more open and more compassionate, way of looking at what has happened or is happening. It is a seeing not in terms of self, not through the lens of self.


What we can practise then, at first after an event that we are seeing with blame, is a ‘re-viewing’, a looking again in a different manner, in a way that takes at least some of the suffering out of it. There is a deconstruction, a softening of a view that has calcified. And this requires the head and the heart working together. Clarity and thoroughness are here in the service of compassion.


Since, in blame, our vision tends to be too narrow, it is vital to take into account a broad enough spread of contributing conditions to open out the view. Thus it can sometimes be helpful to make sure to consider four kinds of possibly relevant conditions.


We can search for and acknowledge the force of what we might call the ‘present, inner’ conditions – the states of mind, beliefs, perceptions, etc. that were active within us at the time. In the situation above, your tiredness would be an example of a ‘present, inner’ condition. We should also scrutinize the ‘present, outer’ though – those conditions present in the outer environment at the time that were impacting – for instance, the manner in which your friend was sharing her story. Likewise, it will be helpful to ponder the ‘past, inner’ conditions – for example, states or habits of the citta set up within us before the event. Perhaps in the above situation, the feelings left unresolved from your last meeting might be regarded as ‘past, inner’ conditions. And fourth, the effects of ‘past, outer’ conditions – external impressions and influences from our history – can also be brought to mind.


We are not adopting and clinging to a view here that would have us never take responsibility, or never be able to accept someone’s appreciation for what we have done. For sometimes it is of course important to feel ourselves take responsibility for our actions and choices, and similarly to appreciate the good that we and others have made manifest.


As always, the crucial and overarching question is: What way of looking contributes to suffering, and what way of looking to ending suffering? And the answer will vary from situation to situation. To emphasize again something we have already voiced: in this area, and in so much of the work with emptiness practices, we seek a flexibility of view – to be able to pick up a view of self and situation when it is helpful, and, when it is not, to put it down and look in a different way that is more helpful.


When what has happened feels very significant or has had significant consequences, views of blame, inflamed by the emotional charge, easily become repetitive. Then the self can become bound in a tight and painful orbit of obsession – both with the past and with whatever self-view has been crystallized and clung to. That is to be trapped in feelings of guilt. If the view can be opened up in the way suggested, it may still be that we feel remorse for something in the past we have done or neglected to do. This emotion of remorse may in fact be an important part of healing. And it differs from guilt. Less rigid and constricted, softer and more compassionate, remorse actually has its own kind of beauty. Significantly, it recognizes and is more concerned with the skill and beneficence of actions, rather than making conclusions about selves. And rather than being caught in obsession about the past, it looks to the future with a sense of possibility and of heartfelt aspiration to choose differently next time.


In the not-so-emotionally-charged example of rushing for the train, I certainly could take some lessons from the escapade, but not blame or guilt, nor conclusions about my self. It would be more helpful for me to reconsider such factors as how much work I try to do on the morning of travelling, or the possibility of packing at least a little in advance. Then I would be considering in terms of conditions rather than self. And I would be looking creatively and helpfully toward the future rather than being stuck in the past.


The fact that any thing that exists or that comes into being does so dependent on countless other things as supporting conditions is one of the basic meanings of dependent arising.


A performer or speaker who pays attention to this will notice, however, that the way the talk is (the particular words that come out of the mouth, the turn of phrase, the tone of voice, the energy level, etc.) arises symbiotically with the quality of the listening, with the energies and attitudes in the room as the talk unfolds. They influence each other hugely. How one is listened to depends on how one is speaking of course; but it also depends on all kinds of other factors, including, for example, the histories of those listening, their interests, their capacities to understand, and their energy levels. And just these last, for example, might in turn be dependent on such things as the prevalent mood of each listener, how rested they are, what they have been doing recently, and what and how much they have eaten in the last few hours. ‘How it is’ depends on the total mixing and interaction of an extensive range of conditions. In a very real and palpable sense, everyone gives the talk, not just the speaker.

**Note:** Totally true with theatre


In relating, our reactions, interpretations, communications, and subtle signals, intended and unintended, feed off and impact each other all the time, whether we are aware of it or not. Thankfully though, if we can acknowledge this and become interested in it, the possibilities of reconciliation open up. If it becomes our shared basis for understanding, then two people having a difficulty can become two looking together at the dynamics of their relating, on the same team untangling the dependent arising of a problem, rather than two accusing, two at war.


In addition to such effects on perceptions (and we will come to talk much more about the fundamental and far-reaching effects any view, or way of looking, has on perception) it may also be that the view affects, to some extent, how the whole situation unfolds externally. For it is immediately clear that if the view softens, emotions and reactivities soften too, and this softening is naturally communicated into the whole mix of conditions. The ‘present, inner’ conditions being then different, the web of conditions is in fact different.


Practice: Ending blame through recognizing the confluence of conditions


If there is something from the past for which you are blaming yourself, take some time – either in formal meditation, or quietly reflecting, or with a spiritual friend – to consider the broader range of conditions on which whatever happened was dependent. Make sure you include the loose categories of ‘present, inner’, ‘present, outer’, ‘past, inner’, and ‘past, outer’ conditions in your considerations.


Notice if there is a condition that you come to which you feel is ‘you’, or for which you believe you are to blame. Can you see that this too is dependent on other conditions that are not ‘you’, and identify what they are? Notice what effect this re-viewing has on your perception of and feelings about what happened, and on notions of self-blame or guilt.


Re-view this event many times in this way. Even if it feels immediately helpful, the shift in view probably needs consolidating. Alternatively, if it feels like it does not help much, it may yet be that it gains power through repetition, or with the help of a friend kindly pointing out your ‘blind spots’. It is also important to practise this shift in view on many events and situations, ones that feel quite difficult and charged, and also those that feel less so. See if you can practise viewing a situation or a phenomenon that has arisen in the present in the same way. What effect does this have? If there is some apprehension regarding an impending situation, could you also consider that situation in this way? Whenever there is a lingering blaming of another person, a similar contemplative process may potentially be directed toward them. Although we usually have less knowledge of the specific variety of conditions that were operating for another, the same principles hold, and reflecting on this can often dissolve blame.


A part of the freedom that comes with any degree of realizing emptiness is a freedom to view in different ways. And in fact there will be countless times when it is not only necessary, but most helpful, not to emphasize the view of emptiness. Sometimes seeing in terms of self is the most appropriate way of seeing, and the one that relieves the dukkha of a particular situation most satisfactorily.


For many, learning how to care for the self, in the terms of the self, is a crucial strand in practice. To recognize and honour needs, to communicate and voice what is true and important for us, to connect with and learn to relate well to the emotions – these are vital skills. And so too are the learning to hold one’s self in tenderness and kindness, and to cherish and even celebrate oneself.


Commonly we do not realize quite how malleable is the story of our life, how much flexibility is possible in the way of seeing it, interpreting it, and expressing it. The narrative of my journey – not only my present and my future story, but also the story of my past – is not completely fixed, simply and objectively ‘given’, engraved in stone. Significantly, we can see our story, and thus also ourselves (who must be central to the story), in ways that imprison and disempower us, or render us, for instance, as a victim in some way. Alternatively, we can loosen a little the chains of the stories that bind us, and see our journey in ways that heal, that empower and inspire us, give us energy, possibility, direction, and meaning.


The story we end up telling and the identity we adopt necessarily go together as a package. Just as do a theatre play and a character within that play, narrative and identity must imply and weave into each other. And as with the story of our life, to a certain extent at least, we may well have more choice of identity than we believe.


Identifying oneself as a ‘seeker’ rather than a ‘college dropout’, for example, will bring a considerably different interpretation to and evaluation of many facts of one’s past, present, and future, changing the whole relationship with these aspects of life. What such things as ‘work’, ‘money’, ‘status’, and ‘security’ mean to us depends on the identity we imagine for ourselves.


Being locked into a story, however, believing that this narrative and the fantasy of self-identity that it involves are ultimately true, with no room or freedom to story ourselves and our life differently, nor any ability to experience times of letting go of narrative ways of looking and seeing through other lenses – that is the problem.


In our exploration of blame we began to expose one way of looking typical of the root delusion of self: a tendency to ‘self-reference’ things and events. Too quickly, for example, we infer that the arising or the presence of this or that means something about ourselves.


At times, therefore, when we feel the contraction of dukkha around some thing, it can be powerfully helpful to ask: What am I making this mean?


So when there is suffering around a certain thing that has occurred or a certain element of experience, a related second question we can ask is: From the huge variety and totality of moments of sense impressions today or in a certain situation, why is this phenomenon fixated upon and not something else?


Correspondingly, of course, we may ask a third question: What am I not giving significance to then? What am I perhaps not even noticing?


It can be very instructive to notice what we repeat, to ourselves and to others, about ourselves, but it may take a subtlety of attention to notice the more subtle manifestations of self-definition.


Again though, a continuity of mindfulness as we go through a day punctures the pervasiveness of the view, exposes the holes in what we assume to be the seamless fabric of how we are. If, for instance, I am clinging tightly and rigidly to a self-definition that I am an angry person, then sustaining attention carefully I cannot help but notice that there are times when I am not angry. Thus we witness clearly and undeniably the absences of the qualities we believe define us. And more than likely, we witness too the presences at times in ourselves of qualities opposite to those ‘self-defining’ ones.


Often we simply do not see all that is within us. There may be certain thoughts, emotions, intentions and drives, and even sub-personalities that we are habitually inclined not to notice and acknowledge. It can be instructive to ask oneself therefore: What do I tend to miss or ignore when I look at myself?


A young man told me, for example, of his habit of procrastinating by watching TV; and he saw in this pattern only a sign of weakness or an expression of fear of failure. As we talked, though, it became clear that such procrastination was also hiding a deep love of doing things well, of abandoning himself to a work project. There were other, not immediately evident, reasons why he was holding back from giving himself and from letting his love initiate action. And somehow in the partiality of awareness that love was going unacknowledged. In such ways and in others, parts of ourselves can remain obscured and their expression blocked.


What quality within me, or what aspect of myself, am I assuming is the reason for this behaviour (or this thought, or this mood)?


Often due, again, to the usually unrecognized force of influence of those around us, we can easily believe that we should be – i.e., act, dress, talk, feel, etc. – a certain way. Too readily we may have absorbed and taken on certain collectively held assumptions of the particular sub-cultures we move in. It is therefore powerful also to ask ourselves, as freshly as possible, and with an intent to expose old assumptions: What do I stifle within myself?


Yes, the self and the personality are empty. But the emptiness of some thing does not make it essentially worthless. Being empty, indeed partly because it is empty, how a thing manifests – its particular appearance – can, more than merely being tolerated, also in fact be celebrated. For when any phenomenon, including personality, is deeply understood to be void, other dimensions of its beauty become apparent.


10 Dependent Origination (1)


A good deal of what we have explored thus far could be expressed in the terms of the Buddha’s teaching on dependent origination (Pali: paṭiccasamuppāda). Although it can be interpreted as describing the processes of rebirth of sentient beings from one life to the next, this teaching can also serve as an explication, or a schematic map, of how both dukkha and the self-sense are constructed – in the moment and over time – within one life.


That said, a common formulation of paṭiccasamuppāda reads: With delusion (avijjā) as condition, there are concoctions (saṅkhārā); With concoctions as condition, consciousness; With consciousness as condition, mentality-materiality (nāmarūpa); With mentality-materiality as condition, the six sense spheres; With the six sense spheres as condition, contact; With contact as condition, vedanā; With vedanā as condition, craving; With craving as condition, clinging; With clinging as condition, becoming (bhava); With becoming as condition, birth; With birth as condition, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and tribulation. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering (dukkha).2


As we’ve already said, the most fundamental meaning of avijjā is ignorance of emptiness. Since this necessarily includes ignorance of dependent arising, avijjā also implies a way of looking at your situation that is ignorant of – and ignores – this process of the arising, and possible ceasing, of dukkha. Rather than a way of looking at the circumstances and your experience in these terms – which would be to look at them through the lens of dependent origination and the Four Noble Truths – you automatically view them from the perspective of your own story, which has hardened over time into an unquestioned truth (also avijjā).


It is important to understand and explore the possibilities of non-linearity in the conditioning processes of paṭiccasamuppāda. Rather than elaborating more of these potential sub-loops, however, it would probably be more useful to ponder many situations for yourself in these terms, in order to gain some familiarity with comprehending the workings of dependent origination at this level. Since avijjā is a lack of awareness of paṭiccasamuppāda, such familiarity will contribute generally to lessening the ways the mind becomes entangled in suffering.


A Map for Relieving Dukkha


Recognizing saṅkhārā


Even an awareness of what particular saṅkhārā (patterns and tendencies of reaction, view, expectation) are operating for you can be helpful. These saṅkhārā may be long-term habitual tendencies. Or they may simply arise due to the state of citta at the time, since any state of the heart will tend to spawn reactions and views that are shaped by it.


Attending to craving and to vedanā: Two strategies


Exploring this whole nexus of craving and reactivity a little further, we find, on more mindful inspection, that the experience of craving itself is an experience of dukkha.


These gut reactions to vedanā, and to craving itself, will frequently be fuelled by thought and proliferation about the object craved. The thinking mind unhelpfully obsessing and circling around the object of grasping or aversion only stokes the fires of craving and the energetic impulses of reactivity. Conversely, without care, the unpleasant pressure of the craving can fuel the proliferation of usually unhelpful thought. It is important to see these feedback loops and how they ensnare the mind in dukkha.


One possibility would be to pay attention to the experience of craving itself, and the feelings of pressure or tension that go with it, particularly in the body. Without wise awareness, there is typically an impulsive grasping for any possible escape from the feeling of growing pressure or tension that accompanies craving.


A second possibility involves stationing the attention on the actual experience of vedanā, moment to moment. Fixing the mindfulness at this point means that the mind is less swept along by the impulses of craving, so that clinging and the constructions of papañca are not fuelled. Thus they can die down to some degree.


We can see that self-construction depends on some thing being reacted to, made an issue of, or viewed in certain ways. That thing may be conceived as an inner phenomenon or an outer one, but the sense of self cannot be supported without depending on some thing or other as a kind of base.


In many instances, of course, we can actually witness a process in time. We see one element have an effect on another, and then this second element feeding back later on the first element. We should be cautious, though, to conclude that this is the whole of what the teaching of dependent origination is pointing to, merely with a complexity and at a rate that is impossible for us personally to see. It is important to admit, and be aware, that more often we may be merely assuming the operation of such feedback loops that are too fast to witness. The very normal tendency of fundamental delusion is to conceive of causality as a process in time.


Buddhist psychology counts six sense ‘spheres’: the five familiar to traditional Western psychology (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch) with cognition of mental objects (thoughts, images, and mental perceptions) as the sixth.


Besides whatever thoughts about the self are present or absent, with every state of the citta there will be a way the self – along with the body, and the citta – is felt and sensed. We can call this aspect of the perception of self the sense of self or the self-sense. When we feel embarrassed or afraid, for example, the sense of self tends to feel more contracted, more solid, and also more separate from others and from the world. In contrast, when we feel relaxed, or generous, say, the sense of self is more open and spacious; it usually feels lighter then too, and there is less of a sense of separation from others and the world.


First, that there is a spectrum or continuum to our self-sense.


The movement of the self-sense along this spectrum presents us with one aspect of a basic and pervasive opportunity for comprehending voidness. It may take some practice, but recognizing that there is a spectrum to the sense of self, becoming familiar with the range of that spectrum and the manifestations of the self-sense within it, as well as gradually developing a sensitivity to the subtle differences along the continuum – these are all indispensable to our approach to insight into emptiness.


Practice: Noticing the sense of self Begin to include in your practice, both in and out of formal meditation, an awareness of the sense of self, and how that sense fluctuates and moves along a continuum.


Notice how the self-sense feels at times of different degrees of dukkha, and when there is upset about something or other. Pay particular attention to the sense of contraction and the perceptions and feelings of solidity and separation that comprise the self-sense at one end of its spectrum.


Notice too how the sense of self feels at times of more ease, and particularly at different times in meditation. Especially important is to notice the quality of the self-sense in periods of greater quietude, when mettā, mindfulness, or samādhi are stronger. Notice how the sense of the body mirrors the sense of the self.


In exposing more precisely and fully the ways we tend to conceive of the self’s relation with body and mind, it can be helpful to conceptually divide up ‘body and mind’ into smaller constituents. One way of doing this is to use the Buddha’s formulation of ‘the five aggregates’ (Skt: skandha; Pali: khandha).4 We can list and define them, for now, as follows:


rūpa – ‘body’, ‘matter’ or ‘materiality’, and also any ‘form’ perceived possessing shape etc.;


vedanā – ‘sensation’, but specifically the ‘feeling-tone’ of sensations,


saṃjñā (Skt.), saññā (Pali) – ‘perception’;


saṃskārā (Skt.), saṅkhārā (Pali) – ‘mental formations’ or ‘concoctions’, including thoughts, intentions and volitions, and mental factors like attention etc. which play a part in fabricating experience;


vijñāna (Skt.), viññāṇa (Pali) – ‘consciousness’, i.e. any of the six sense-consciousnesses (consciousness of any phenomena of the five senses and of mental phenomena).


The frame of reference of the skandhas provides us with a loose, but comprehensive, kind of checklist for exposing all possible self-conceptions, and then learning to let these go. For included in this list of five aggregates are all the phenomena of existence with which we might conceivably identify or which we might assume a possession of. Everything in phenomenal existence may in fact be placed somewhere in these piles. The teaching of the aggregates thus presents us with a framework for meditatively investigating and flushing out even the more subtle and perhaps hidden conceptions and views of self.


Within the variety of such powerfully liberating ways of looking which the Buddha recommended practitioners develop, he often emphasized training in three perceptions in particular. All conditioned phenomena, he noted, can be seen to be impermanent (anicca), unsatisfactory (dukkha), and not-self (anattā). Used skilfully as a meditative lens – a way of looking – each of these three perceptions provides a vitalizing and significant avenue that opens joy, peace, and freedom, as well as various possibilities


At the end of any day, we can, for instance, take time to reflect and remember the many different states that the citta has moved through over the course of that day. Citta states change; they are never permanent. Simple as this is, carefully noticing it over and over at this everyday level, the insight and its implications start to impress more genuinely into our minds.


- Practice: Awareness of change at an everyday level Regularly take some time at the end of the day to view the day’s experiences from the perspective of anicca. With regard to different aspects of experience – mood, energy levels, and the various sense impressions of your surroundings, for example – carefully recollect and acknowledge the changes and shifting phases that occurred. ([Location 2909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI7PQD8&location=2909))
- After you have gained some familiarity with this reflection, practise bringing this knowledge of the fact of change to your current experiences – of mood, energy levels, sense impressions, etc. – at any time. Regard whatever the experience is with the clear and conscious knowing that it will transform. ([Location 2917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI7PQD8&location=2917))
- Thoughts can be quick, slippery, and seductive, so the attention is easily dragged off into entanglement if mindfulness is not strong enough. Attention to the impermanence of thought is therefore better left to times when there is a degree of samādhi that can sustain it. ([Location 2958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI7PQD8&location=2958))
- Practice: Attending to anicca moment to moment ([Location 3046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI7PQD8&location=3046))
