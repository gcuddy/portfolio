The physical world used to mediate our relationship with the "digital world". Now, the digital world largely mediates our relationships with the physical world — unless you actively resist/step outside these colonized structures.

Some generative images from [[midjourney]]:
![[Analog media generative imagery]]

to be clear:

* [[The key tension of our time is digital vs physical prime]]
  but:
* [[I miss when the physical world mediated our relationship with the digital world]]
* [[The internet used to be a distinct experience; now, it's ubiquitous]]

See also:

* [[§Emotions and technology]]
* [[nostalgia for the early internet]] and [[00s nostalgia]]

Digital interactions can act upon the physical world too: [[Vibration interactions act upon the physical environment]].

The VC-ification of everything is synonymous with digitzation of everything which is synonymous with an Instragam, aka [[airspace]]. We lack funky spaces! ([[Too many places are STERILE and TORCHED — let’s make them COOL and FUNKY]])
