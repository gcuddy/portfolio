# Subsequent Performances by Jonathan Miller
“There is another reason why we esteem works that have been bequeathed to us in a badly worn or damaged condition. In this form the works in question bear witness to their own antiquity, and this is valued for its own sake.”

“**==The way in which a painting is perceived is also influenced by the way in which it is reproduced==**.”
`Same as with film: watching in cinema versus on iPhone. And with music: nice speakers versus shitty earbuds. Not sure it's really true with literature, though...maybe iPhone reading versus physical book?`

“**It seems right and proper to describe the renewed existence of these works of art as afterlives, and to see them not simply as faint or attenuated versions of their previous existences but as full-blooded representations of their existence now**.”

==**Nelson Goodman in ‘Languages of Art’: autographic (identified with handwork) vs allographic (re-created in performance)**==

**Plays cannot be identified with an ideal performance, because it is always possible to imagine a better performance.**

“**Although the text is a necessary condition for the performance it is by no means a sufficient one**. It is short of all these accessories which are, in a sense, the *essence* of performance.”

“**One of the measures of a great play is that it has the capacity to generate an almost infinite series of unforeseeable inflexions**.”

That being said, **a text is not “a Rorschach inkblot into whose indeterminate outlines the director can project whatever he wants**.

“Even if the work is distorted, it **should be possible to map its internal relationships on to those of the original**.”
See: a Mercator projection, p.36-37

“The process of reproducing a performance by copying an electronic replica is fraught with the same problems as forging a painting.”

“**If we had a video copy of the first performance of Shakespeare’s *Twelfth Night*, it is no good saying it exemplifies everything that it shows because people would disagree immediately as to what it is showing**.”

“The claim that something is authentic has already pre-empted the possibility of having an authentic experience.”

**Hamlet’s “speak the speech” shows that the performances were not always what Shakespeare hoped they would be.**

“**The notion of performance would be altered if we were bound by the one canonical production, and plays would, like pictures, become autographic works of ==art. The preservation of the canonical performance, which many people think would express and embody Shakespeare’s intentions, is more likely to cut us off from his vital dramatic imagination as we would be distracted by the foreign gestures and style of acting==.”**
See: Deadly Theatre (Brook), Icke refers to Globe as “museum theatre”

**The theatre is a ==representational system==**. **We have to recognize the existence of a frame within which what is to be seen is taken as representational and beyond which everything to be seen is regarded as part of the real world.**
`Not sure I agree with this...`

The manipulation of representational variables determine the theatrical experience. The producer, director, and designer must understand how these variables are interrelated.
