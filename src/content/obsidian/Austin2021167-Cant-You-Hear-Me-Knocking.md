> The essay concludes with a critique of the metaverse concept, a more regimented simulacrum of public space where a wider range of interactions are easier to monetize—a virtual environment in which we’ll finally have digital walls where we can hang our NFTs, and where we can rub elbows with Marvel’s embodied IP

> Whether the metaverse is an attention-grabbing troll or a genuine strategic priority remains to be seen, but either way it’s mostly just marketing gloss for something more mundane—“virtual reality with unskippable ads,” as Wendy Liu tweeted, a coercive space disguised as something more liberating.

> Rob Horning describes the metaverse as a version of Facebook from which it’s impossible to log off: “Facebook would also like to secure the ability to prevent people from any right to absence. Much as the company has strived to make having a Facebook profile mandatory to get along in everyday life, it would like to make it difficult for people to refuse to be present in the ‘metaverse’…The metaverse is fundamentally a place you will be forced to be.”

> “The hype about the metaverse is in part trying to normalize this already existing condition,” Horning writes. “Consensus reality administered by venture capitalists.”

> Twitter and other social media feeds exhibit this dynamic most clearly; logging off and going outdoors (or just getting away from your phone) feels like the only reliable way to experience true silence now. The metaverse, a proprietary simulation of the physical world, might appear to promise a similar reversal of social media’s chaotic conditions, but as I argued in my Real Life essay, a Facebook or Microsoft metaverse would be the opposite of a commons: a theater for intellectual property in which sensory experience is a fully commoditized resource, every lacuna a content opportunity, and every moment of silence a reason for someone else to speak louder.
