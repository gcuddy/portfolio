## Highlights
- The theatre has been good to me. It has produced great friendships, love, travel, hard work, fun, terror and pleasure. It has also offered an entire life of study. Study is a fulltime engagement which includes reading books, reading people, reading situations, reading about the past and reading the present. To study, you enter into a situation with your whole being, you listen and then begin to move around inside it with your imagination. You can study every situation you are in. You can learn to read life while life is happening. ([Location 62](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=62))
- Artists are individuals willing to articulate in the face of flux and transformation. And the successful artist finds new shapes for our present ambiguities and uncertainties. The artist becomes the creator of the future through the violent act of articulation. ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=75))
- He suggested that, as societies develop, it is the artists who articulate the necessary myths that embody our experience of life and provide parameters for ethics and values. Every so often the inherited myths lose their value because they become too small and confined to contain the complexities of the ever-transforming and expanding societies. In that moment new myths are needed to encompass who we are becoming. These new constructs do not eliminate anything already in the mix; rather, they include fresh influences and engender new formations. The new mythologies always include ideas, cultures and people formerly excluded from the previous mythologies. So, deduces Mee, the history of art is the history of inclusion. ([Location 79](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=79))
- How can we survive in the marketplace and still make art? How can we live in this fast and competitive environment and still walk into a rehearsal able to call upon the wild, violent child in us that makes the art poetic and magnificent and dangerous and terrifying? How can we, in a climate racing for survival, generate gifts with presence and generosity? ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=109))
- Reality is a construct of thought that desires continuity. Actually, the expectation of continuity is a glorious fiction. Reality depends upon our choices of what and how we choose to observe. ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=132))
- I’m interested in remembering and celebrating the American spirit in all of its difficult, ambiguous, and distorted glory. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=209))
- Inside every good play lives a question. A great play asks big questions that endure through time. We enact plays in order to remember relevant questions; we remember these questions in our bodies and the perceptions take place in real time and space. For example, the issue of hubris is an issue that humanity is still working on, which is why certain ancient Greek plays feel completely fresh and current. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=261))
- The act of remembering connects us with the past and alters time. We are living conduits of human memory. The act of memory is a physical act and lies at the heart of the art of the theatre. If the theatre were a verb, it would be ‘to remember’. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=269))
- Today we barely remember the McCarthy era and most of us are not aware of the serious consequences of that forgotten catalyst. Through a brutally effective mechanism, artists were directed to disengage from issues facing the real world. Without this social link, many turned inward. What many of us don’t realize is that this insipid political action has completely influenced the way we make work today. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=308))
- Every time you stage a play, you are embodying a memory. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=341))
- The act of expressing what is remembered is actually, according to the philosopher Richard Rorty, an act of re-description. In redescribing something, new truths are created. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=342))
- Our task, and the task of every artist and scientist, is to re-describe our inherited assumptions and invented fictions in order to create new paradigms for the future. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=345))
- I believe that culture is shared experience. And it is constantly shifting. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=351))
- A minstrel show was the first theatrical production exported from the United States. ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=395))
- pre-eminent designer Robert Edmund Jones advocated Expressionism over Realism: … Realism is something we practice when we aren’t feeling very well. When we don’t feel up to making the extra effort. ([Location 406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=406))
- Eugene O’Neill prescribed, ‘Reject the banality of surfaces!’ Expressionism was … An intensity of vision which tries to catch the throb of life, necessarily doing violence to external facts to lay bare internal facts. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=411))
- Perhaps the 1920s were a reflection of what Americans do best under pressure: a celebration of intensity, magnification, energy and industry; an ability to walk into the room bravely without knowing who or what is there. No other era comes close to the inconceivable outpouring of magnificent music and vigour onstage: George S.Kaufman and his collaborators, Jelly Roll Morton, Bessie Smith, Louis Armstrong, Ma Rainey, the Gershwins, Cole Porter, Ethel Merman, Billy Rose, Irving Berlin, George M.Cohan, Jerome Kern, Fanny Brice, Bert Williams, Oscar Hammerstein II and a whole lot more. ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=421))
- The Americans embraced the Russian experiments passionately and misguidedly by overemphasizing personalized emotional circumstances. Stanislavsky’s system, now watered down to a ‘method’, proved effective for film and television, but in the theatre created an unfortunate stranglehold of emotional indulgence. I believe that the great tragedy of the American stage is the actor who assumes, thanks to our gross misunderstanding of Stanislavsky, ‘If I feel it, the audience will feel it’. ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=442))
- Europeans are, generally speaking, a literary culture. Americans are an aural culture. Our dominant tradition is evangelical. For us, the sound of words takes precedent over their meaning. Although we pretend to be at ease with literature on stage like the Europeans are, in fact we are ill at ease. This pretence of ease makes for a false feel in the theatre. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=464))
- I feel that we theatre practitioners today are too timid in our exploitation of the shoulders upon which we stand. Compared to the theatre’s rapid growth and complex adjustments to the innovations, events and movements of the past several centuries, our progress now seems fainthearted. Acting, for example, is the only artistic enterprise in America that has not changed during the past three-quarters of a century. Most acting today looks pretty much the same as it did in the 1930s. Our work has not grown enough and our conventional goals seem too narrow. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=468))
- Our present high-technology lifestyle demands a theatre experience that cannot be satisfied by video and movie screens. I want acting that is poetic and personal, intimate and colossal. I want to encourage the kind of humanity on the stage that demands attention and that expresses who we are and suggests that life is bigger. And it is for this reason that I’m trying to remember and study the past and combine it with the newest ideas in philosophy, science and art. In order to contribute to an artistic explosion I am researching new approaches to acting for the stage that combine vaudeville, operetta, Martha Graham and postmodern dance. I want to find resonant shapes for our present ambiguities. I want to contribute to a field that will engender moments onstage that broaden the definitions of what it means to be human. ([Location 472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=472))
- We enjoy a rich, diverse and unique history and to celebrate it is to remember it. To remember it is to use it. To use it is to be true to who we are. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=480))
- If we can see ourselves in relation to our predecessors and the impulses behind their innovations, our own theatre will necessarily become more intense, poetic, metaphoric, humane and expressive. Our collective dreams will be bigger; the arenas will become more compelling. Perhaps as we remember the past we will find ourselves able to create with more energy and articulation. ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=488))
- Art is violent. To be decisive is violent. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=523))
- When an actor achieves a spontaneous, intuitive, or passionate moment in rehearsal, the director utters the fateful words ‘keep it’, eliminating all other potential solutions. ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=525))
- The decisiveness, the cruelty, which has extinguished the spontaneity of the moment, demands that the actor begin an extraordinary work: to resurrect the dead. The actor must now find a new, deeper spontaneity within this set form. And this, to me, is why actors are heroes. They accept this violence and work with it, bringing skill and imagination to the art of repetition. ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=528))
- is significant that the French word for rehearsal is repetition. ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=531))
- I like to think of staging, or blocking, as a vehicle in which the actors can move and grow. Paradoxically, it is the restrictions, the precision, the exactitude, that allows for the possibility of freedom. The form becomes a container in which the actor can find endless variations and interpretive freedom. ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=535))
- For the actor, this necessary violence in creating a role for the theatre is distinctly different from the violence necessary in acting for the camera. In film acting, the actor can afford to do something impulsively without any concern for repeating it endlessly. What is vital for the camera is that the moment be spontaneous and photogenic. In the theatre it must be repeatable. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=538))
- Great performances exude both exactness and a powerful sense of freedom. This freedom can only be found within certain chosen limitations. ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=541))
- To be articulate in the face of limitations is where the violence sets in. This act of necessary violence, which at first seems to limit freedom and close down options, in turn opens up many more options and asks for a deeper sense of freedom from the artist. ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=552))
- Risk is a key ingredient in the act of violence and articulation. Without embracing the risk, there can be no progress and no adventure. To attempt to perform articulately from a state of imbalance and risk imbues the action with extraordinary energy. ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=562))
- ‘If you cannot say it,’ wrote the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, ‘point to it/ ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=567))
- To try to say something in a state of flux even if you do not know the right thing to say is the point. Make an observation. To be silent, to avoid the violence of articulation alleviates the risk of failure but at the same time there is also no possibility of advancement. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=575))
- In the heat of creation, there is no time for reflection; there is only connection to what is happening. The analysis, the reflection and the criticism belong before and after, never during, the creative act. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=589))
- ‘What have we been doing all this time?’ I would ask myself in the light of no agreements, no staging, no trampoline with which the actors might tempt the heights. ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=594))
- Censorship is a physical hesitation in the light of a fleeting thought or doubt about how his peers might receive what he is writing, whether or not they will like it or if it will get published. In the light of our hesitations, we must be deeply connected to the act. We must be decisive and intuitive simultaneously. ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=602))
- Richard Foreman, perhaps the most intellectual of American directors, said that, for him, creation is one hundred per cent intuitive. ([Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=605))
- As soon as the door closes in rehearsal or as soon as the curtain goes up in performance, there is no time to think or reflect. In these moments of exquisite pressure there is only the intuitive act of articulation within the crisis of action. ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=608))
- What is instantly definable is often instantly forgettable. Anything onstage can be asleep when it is overly defined. ([Location 619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=619))
- Victor Schklovsky, the Russian Formalist who undoubtedly influenced Bertolt Brecht with his Four Essays on Formalism written in the 1920s, developed significant theories on the function of art. Everything around us, he wrote, is asleep. The function of art is to awaken what is asleep. How do you awaken what is asleep? According to Schklovsky, you turn it slightly until it awakens. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=621))
- Creativity is first of all an act of destruction. (Pablo Picasso) ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=633))
- When you begin a picture, you often make some pretty discoveries. You must be on guard against these. Destroy the thing, do it several times. In each destroying of a beautiful discovery, the artist does not really suppress it, but rather transforms it, condenses it, makes it more substantial. What comes out in the end is the result of the discarded finds. Otherwise, you become your own connoisseur. I sell myself nothing. (Pablo Picasso) ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=636))
- An audience in the theatre should be engaged by the events but also slightly distressed about what is happening. The interactions, the words and the actions onstage have to be fresh and untamed and undismissible. Actors are confronted with the enormous task of awakening sleeping clichés. For example, the words ‘I love you’, because they have been said so often, have no meaning unless they are undefined, distorted, turned and offered up anew. Only then might they be fresh and hearable. ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=641))
- Another kind of violence is the violence of disagreement. I believe that it is in disagreement that certain truths about the human condition are revealed. It is when images, ideas or people disagree that one senses the truth. These disagreements can be found everywhere in art. ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=652))
- Truth, which is an experience and not something easily defined, mostly exists in the space between opposites. ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=659))
- One cannot look directly at the truly big human issues any more than one can look directly at the sun. In order to see the sun you look slightly to the side. Between the sun and where you are looking is the perception of the sun. In art and in the theatre we use metaphor as the thing to the side. Through metaphor we see the truth about our condition. ([Location 668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=668))
- To generate the indispensable excitement there must be something at stake, at risk, something momentous and uncertain. A sure thing does not arouse us emotionally. ([Location 680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=680))
- your passion and excitement about something will take you the distance through uncertainty. ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=682))
- sat down to wait and watched the young director make a fatal flaw. An actor approached her and asked what he should do with a particular chair. In her haste and nervousness, she said these words: ‘It doesn’t matter.’ ([Location 688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=688))
- Something matters to an audience only if you make it matter. If you attend to it, if only for a moment, the commitment of your attention will create the tension of attention. ([Location 690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=690))
- To decide is an act of violence, yet decisiveness and cruelty are part of the collaborative process that the theatre offers. Decisions give birth to limitations which in turn ask for a creative use of the imagination. ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=696))
- It’s not about the right idea or even the right decision, rather it is about the quality of decisiveness. ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=701))
- The role of attraction and eroticism in the theatre is rarely discussed and yet both are vital ingredients in the creative act and in the dynamics between audiences and the actors. In order to investigate the issues of attraction and eroticism, this chapter follows the archetypical pattern of a passionate relationship. 1  Something or someone stops you in your tracks. 2  You feel ‘drawn’ to it. 3  You sense its energy and power. 4  It disorientates you. 5  You make first contact; it responds. 6  You experience extended intercourse. 7  You are changed irrevocably. ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=709))
- I have always been attracted to the challenge of getting to know what I cannot instantly categorize or dismiss, whether an actor’s presence, a painting, a piece of music, or a personal relationship. It is the journey towards the object of attraction that interests me. ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=724))
- An authentic work of art embodies intense energy. It demands response. You can either avoid it, shut it out, or meet it and tussle. It contains attractive and complicated energy fields and a logic all its own. ([Location 728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=728))
- In the theatre, the way a show begins has everything to do with the quality of the journey. Do the first moments stop me in my tracks? And how do they do that? As an audience, I can usually feel the promise of a remarkable theatre experience in the very first instants. ([Location 745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=745))
- The best beginnings feel both surprising and inevitable. ([Location 748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=748))
- We are each incomplete. We are drawn towards the other in search of completeness. ([Location 757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=757))
- human beings are attracted, physically and emotionally, towards places where the elements meet: where earth meets water, and water meets air, and air meets fire, etc. ([Location 766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=766))
- The theatre is a place where it is possible to meet one another in an energetic space unmediated by technology. The sensory stimulation allowed in theatre, authorized by its very form, allows the corporeal imagination to exercise itself. ([Location 775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=775))
- Erotic tension between actors and audience is part of the recipe for effective drama. The attraction of the theatre is the promise of a proximity with actors in a place where the corporeal imagination might experience extended intercourse. ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=777))
- En route to rehearsal I want the sensation of heading towards an exciting, romantic, turbulent rendezvous. A rehearsal should feel like a date. Both as a director and as an audience member, I want to find the actors attractive, uncategorizable and undismissable. The best productions I have directed issue from a rehearsal process charged with erotic interest. ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=783))
- A great actor, like a great striptease artist, withholds more than she or he shows. Artists, as they mature, come closer to the great wisdom found in the potent combination of physical containment and emotional expansion. Restraint is key. Take the moment and all of its complexities; concentrate it, let it cook, and then contain it. This concentration and restraint generates energy in the actor and interest in the audience. Zeami, the Japanese originator of Noh drama, suggested that the actor should always withhold a certain percentage of her or his passion. … When you feel ten in your heart, express seven… ([Location 791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=791))
- Art, like life, is understood through experience, not explanations. As theatre artists, we cannot create an experience for an audience; rather, our job is to set up the circumstances in which an experience might occur. ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=810))

- Every great journey begins with disorientation. ([Location 814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=814))
- I know that the attempt to find balance from an imbalanced state is always productive and interesting and yields rich results. ([Location 819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=819))
- Falling in love is disorientating because the boundaries between new lovers are not fixed. ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=820))
- A great theatre event is also disorientating because the boundaries between who is giving and who is receiving are not distinct. An exciting artist plays with our expectations and with our memory. ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=822))
- I want to use the theatre to question the limits and boundaries of human experience. In every play I direct I want to question my formal, aesthetic, structural and narrative assumptions. I want to allow for necessary personal disorientation in order to make contact with the material and the people involved. And I want to include disorientation as a thread in the fabric of every production. ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=828))
- Quantum physics teaches us that the act of observation alters the thing observed. To observe is to disturb. ‘To observe’ is not a passive verb. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=839))
- Listening to the listening, the actor makes adjustments in the speed of an entrance, the intensity of the first line spoken or the length of a pause. An actor learns when to hold back and when to open up based on the agility of the audience. ([Location 854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=854))
- Attention is a tension. ([Location 862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=862))
- As a director, my biggest contribution to a production, and the only real gift I can offer to an actor, is my attention. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=864))
- narcissism. A director’s job is to be connected to the stage, physically, imaginatively and emotionally. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=871))
- The late William Ball, the founding Artistic Director of ACT/San Francisco, wrote in his book A Sense of Direction that he considers an audience heroic because they choose to spend two hours not thinking about themselves. ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=873))
- The rehearsal is a microcosm of the extended intercourse of attention offered by an audience. It is a place of potential rapture. In a rehearsal room, like making love, the outside world is excluded. It is a process of arousal, heightened sensation, alive nerve endings and sudden pinnacles. ([Location 876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=876))
- The primary tool in a creative process is interest. To be true to one’s interest, to pursue it successfully, one’s body is the best barometer. The heart races. The pulse soars. Interest can be your guide. It always points you in the right direction. It defines the quality, energy and content of your work. You cannot feign or fake interest or choose to be interested in something because it is prescribed. It is never prescribed. It is discovered. When you sense this quickening you must act immediately. You must follow that interest and hold on tight. ([Location 887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=887))
- If the interest is genuine and large enough and if it is pursued with tenacity and generosity, the boomerang effect is resounding. Interest returns volley to affect your life and inevitably alter it. You must be available and attentive to the doors that open unexpectedly. You cannot wait. The doors close fast. It will change your life. It will give you adventures you never expected. You must be true to it and it will be true to you. ([Location 894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=894))
- never talk down to an audience. It was immediately clear to me that the experience of theatre was not about us understanding the meaning of the play or the significance of the staging. We were invited into a unique world, an arena that changed everything previously defined. ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=933))
- Most of the truly remarkable experiences I’ve had in the theatre have filled me with uncertainty and disorientation. ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=937))
- The artist’s responsibility is to bring the potential, the mystery and terror, the trembling, back. James Baldwin wrote, ‘The purpose of art is to lay bare the questions which have been hidden by the answers.’ ([Location 944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=944))
- I had to learn to work in trust and not in fear of that terror. I was relieved to find that the theatre is a useful place to concentrate that energy. Out of the almost uncontrollable chaos of life, I could create a place of beauty and a sense of community. In the most terrible depths of doubt and difficulty, I found encouragement and inspiration in collaborating with others. We have been able to create an atmosphere of grace, intensity and love. I have created a refuge for myself, for actors and for audiences through the metaphor that is theatre. ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=948))
- I believe that theatre’s function is to remind us of the big human issues to remind us of our terror and our humanity. ([Location 952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=952))
- From cave drawings to ecstatic dances around numberless fires; from Hedda Gabler raising her pistol, to the disintegration of Blanche Dubois, we create shapes that deal with our distress. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=955))
- I have found that theatre that does not channel terror has no energy. We create out of fear, not from a place of security and safety. ([Location 956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=956))
- I am convinced that the most dynamic and thrilling choices are made when there is a trust in the process, in the artists and in the material. The saving grace in one’s work is love, trust and a sense of humour—trust in collaborators and the creative act in rehearsal, love for the art and a sense of humour about the impossible task. These are the elements that bring grace into a rehearsal situation and onto the stage. In the face of terror, beauty is created and hence, grace. ([Location 964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=964))
- We all tremble in terror before the impossibility of beginning. It is important to remember that a director’s work, as with any artist, is intuitive. Many young directors make the big mistake of assuming that directing is about being in control, telling others what to do, having ideas and getting what you ask for. I do not believe that these abilities are the qualities that make a good director or exciting theatre. Directing is about feeling, about being in the room with other people; with actors, with designers with an audience. It is about having a feel for time and space, about breathing, and responding fully to the situation at hand, being able to plunge and encourage a plunge into the unknown at the right moment. ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=981))
- I know that I cannot sit down when work is happening on the stage. If I sit, a deadness sets in. I direct from impulses in my body responding to the stage, the actors’ bodies, their inclinations. ([Location 990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=990))
- When I am lost in rehearsal, when I am stymied and have no idea what to do next or how to solve a problem, I know that this is the moment to make a leap. ([Location 994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=994))
- For me, the essential aspect of a given work is its vitality. This vitality, or energy, is a reflection of the artist’s courageousness in the face of her or his own terror. The creation of art is not an escape from life but a penetration into it. ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1004))
- Americans are plagued with the disease of agreement. In the theatre, we often presume that collaboration means agreement. I believe that too much agreement creates productions with no vitality, no dialectic, no truth. ([Location 1023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1023))
- Perhaps we can stop trying so hard to be innovative and original; rather, our charge is to receive tradition and utilize the containers we inherit by filling them with our own wakefulness. The boundaries of these containers, their limits, can serve to magnify the experience of entering them. ([Location 1099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1099))
- Because we can walk and talk, we assume that we can act. But an actor actually has to reinvent walking and talking to be able to perform those actions effectively upon the stage. ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1101))
- The actor must ‘put a fire’ under these clichés in order to bring them to life. ([Location 1106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1106))
- I believe that it is better to set the exterior (the form, the action) and allow the interior (the quality of being, the ever-altering emotional landscape) freedom to move and change in every repetition. ([Location 1182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1182))
- The lines between actors on the stage should never go slack. ([Location 1201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1201))
- When approaching stereotype as an ally, you do not embrace a stereotype in order to hold it rigid; rather, you burn through it, undefining it and allowing human experience to perform its alchemy. ([Location 1205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1205))

- the theatre we reach out and touch the past through literature, history and memory so that we might receive and relive significant and relevant human questions in the present and then pass them on to future generations.

- Embarrassment is a teacher. A good actor risks embarrassment in every moment. There is nothing more thrilling than to be in rehearsal with an actor who is willing to set foot into embarrassing territory. The uneasiness keeps the lines tight. If you try to avoid being embarrassed by what you do, nothing will happen because the territory remains safe and unexposed. Embarrassment engenders a glow and a presence and a dissolving of habit. ([Location 1323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1323))
    - Note: I call this vulnerability. But, very similar.
- If I adopt the attitude that the project is an adventure larger than anything I might imagine, an entity that will challenge me to find an instinctual path through it, the project will be allowed its proper magnitude. ([Location 1333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1333))
- The enemy of art is assumption: the assumption that you know what you are doing, the assumption that you know how to walk and how to talk, the assumption that what you ‘mean’ will mean the same thing to those who receive it. ([Location 1345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1345))
- A director cannot hide from an audience because intentions are always visible, palpable. An audience senses your attitude towards them. They smell your fright or condescension. They know instinctively that you want only to impress or conquer. They sense your engagement or lack of it. These qualities live in your body and are visible in your work. You must have a reason to do what it is you do because these reasons are felt by anyone who comes in contact with your work. It matters how you treat people, how you take responsibility in a crisis, what values you develop, your politics, what you read, how you speak and even which words you choose. You cannot hide. ([Location 1361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1361))

- Be prepared to leap at the appropriate moment and you will never know when the moment will be appropriate. The door opens and you must go through it with no consideration for the consequences. You leap. But you must also accept that the leap itself does not guarantee anything. And it does not mitigate the embarrassment; rather, it heightens it. ([Location 1385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1385))
- It is not the director’s responsibility to produce results but, rather, to create the circumstances in which something might happen. ([Location 1415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1415))
- To arrive at a place where something sufficiently embarrassing can happen, I place my attention on the circumstances of the rehearsal.

- How do you get out of your own way? First, accept the paradox that theatre is artifice yet our search is for authenticity—art, as Picasso said, is the lie that tells the truth. Despite the artifice we search for spontaneity and freedom. But to enter that paradise, you cannot enter through the front gates; you must go around to the back door. ([Location 1469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1469))

And these shapes contain energy, memory and necessary ambiguity. ([Location 1516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1516))

- Academic art simply validates the research. It does not challenge it. ([Location 1531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1531))
- These experiences taught me to appreciate the resistances that life offers and to recognize them as an ally. There will always be resistances and obstacles no matter what the situation. Whether at a huge subsidized theatre or a tiny community theatre, in a city or in the countryside, something or someone will always present resistance. The question becomes: how can you use the difficulties and obstacles to help rather than discourage expression? ([Location 1588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1588))
- If there are not enough obstacles in a given process, the result can lack rigour and depth. ([Location 1616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1616))
- Resistance heightens and magnifies the effort. Meeting a resistance, confronting an obstacle, or overcoming a difficulty always demands creativity and intuition. In the heat of the conflict, you have to call on new reserves of energy and imagination. You develop your muscles in the act of overcoming resistance—your artist muscles. Like a dancer, you have to practise regularly to keep up muscularity. The magnitude of the resistances you choose to engage determines the progression and depth of your work. The larger the obstacles, the more you will transform in the effort. ([Location 1617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1617))
- Try not to think of anything as a problem. Start with a forgiving relationship to laziness and impatience and cultivate a sense of humour about them both. And then trick them. Start a task or an activity before you are ready or after you are ‘not ready’. ([Location 1684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1684))
- It is natural and human to seek union and restore balance from the imbalance of engagement with discord. Recite an entire Shakespeare soliloquy from a physical state of imbalance. In the attempt to maintain equilibrium and not topple over while you speak, every part of your being reaches out for balance, harmony and union. This struggle is positive and productive. Suddenly the body speaks with astonishing clarity and necessity. The struggle requires precision and articulation. ([Location 1693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1693))
    - Note: Like Taibi's exercise to say the speech on a bucket.
- Art is a defiance of death. There will never be enough encouragement and support and we are all going to die. So why bother? Why put so much effort into a liminal activity? Why should we struggle so hard with a business that is at its heart only artifice? ([Location 1716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1716))
- Utopia is now. The act of making theatre is already utopian because art is an act of resistance against circumstances. If you are making theatre now, you have already successfully achieved utopia. ([Location 1722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1722))
- Why not choose a play that is just beyond your reach? The reach is what changes you and gives your work energy and vitality. ([Location 1725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SES9T2&location=1725))
- Allow me to propose a few suggestions about how to handle the natural resistances that your circumstances might offer. Do not assume that you have to have some prescribed conditions to do your best work. Do not wait Do not wait for enough time or money to accomplish what you think you have in mind. Work with what you have right now. Work with the people around you right now. Work with the architecture you see around you right now. Do not wait for what you assume is the appropriate, stress-free environment in which to generate expression. Do not wait for maturity or insight or wisdom. Do not wait till you are sure that you know what you are doing. Do not wait until you have enough technique. What you do now, what you make of your present circumstances will determine the quality and scope of your future endeavours. And, at the same time, be patient.

# A Director Prepares: Seven Essays on Art and Theatre by Anne Bogart
The theatre has been good to me. It has produced great friendships, love, travel, hard work, fun, terror and pleasure. It has also offered an entire life of study. Study is a fulltime engagement which includes reading books, reading people, reading situations, reading about the past and reading the present. To study, you enter into a situation with your whole being, you listen and then begin to move around inside it with your imagination. You can study every situation you are in. You can learn to read life while life is happening.

Artists are individuals willing to articulate in the face of flux and transformation. And the successful artist finds new shapes for our present ambiguities and uncertainties. The artist becomes the creator of the future through the violent act of articulation.

- - - -

He suggested that, as societies develop, it is the artists who articulate the necessary myths that embody our experience of life and provide parameters for ethics and values. Every so often the inherited myths lose their value because they become too small and confined to contain the complexities of the ever-transforming and expanding societies. In that moment new myths are needed to encompass who we are becoming. These new constructs do not eliminate anything already in the mix; rather, they include fresh influences and engender new formations. The new mythologies always include ideas, cultures and people formerly excluded from the previous mythologies. So, deduces Mee, the history of art is the history of inclusion.

- - - -



How can we survive in the marketplace and still make art? How can we live in this fast and competitive environment and still walk into a rehearsal able to call upon the wild, violent child in us that makes the art poetic and magnificent and dangerous and terrifying? How can we, in a climate racing for survival, generate gifts with presence and generosity?

- - - -



Reality is a construct of thought that desires continuity. Actually, the expectation of continuity is a glorious fiction. Reality depends upon our choices of what and how we choose to observe.

- - - -



I’m interested in remembering and celebrating the American spirit in all of its difficult, ambiguous, and distorted glory.

- - - -



**Inside every good play lives a question. A great play asks big questions that endure through time**. We enact plays in order to remember relevant questions; we remember these questions in our bodies and the perceptions take place in real time and space. For example, the issue of hubris is an issue that humanity is still working on, which is why certain ancient Greek plays feel completely fresh and current.

- - - -



The act of remembering connects us with the past and alters time. We are living conduits of human memory. The act of memory is a physical act and lies at the heart of the art of the theatre. If the theatre were a verb, it would be ‘to remember’.

- - - -



Today we barely remember the McCarthy era and most of us are not aware of the serious consequences of that forgotten catalyst. Through a brutally effective mechanism, artists were directed to disengage from issues facing the real world. Without this social link, many turned inward. What many of us don’t realize is that this insipid political action has completely influenced the way we make work today.

- - - -



Every time you stage a play, you are embodying a memory.

- - - -



The act of expressing what is remembered is actually, according to the philosopher Richard Rorty, an act of re-description. In redescribing something, new truths are created.

- - - -



Our task, and the task of every artist and scientist, is to re-describe our inherited assumptions and invented fictions in order to create new paradigms for the future.

- - - -



I believe that culture is shared experience. And it is constantly shifting.

- - - -



A minstrel show was the first theatrical production exported from the United States.

- - - -



pre-eminent designer Robert Edmund Jones advocated Expressionism over Realism: … Realism is something we practice when we aren’t feeling very well. When we don’t feel up to making the extra effort.

- - - -



Eugene O’Neill prescribed, ‘Reject the banality of surfaces!’ Expressionism was … An intensity of vision which tries to catch the throb of life, necessarily doing violence to external facts to lay bare internal facts.

- - - -



Perhaps the 1920s were a reflection of what Americans do best under pressure: a celebration of intensity, magnification, energy and industry; an ability to walk into the room bravely without knowing who or what is there. No other era comes close to the inconceivable outpouring of magnificent music and vigour onstage: George S.Kaufman and his collaborators, Jelly Roll Morton, Bessie Smith, Louis Armstrong, Ma Rainey, the Gershwins, Cole Porter, Ethel Merman, Billy Rose, Irving Berlin, George M.Cohan, Jerome Kern, Fanny Brice, Bert Williams, Oscar Hammerstein II and a whole lot more.

- - - -



The Americans embraced the Russian experiments passionately and misguidedly by overemphasizing personalized emotional circumstances. Stanislavsky’s system, now watered down to a ‘method’, proved effective for film and television, but in the theatre created an unfortunate stranglehold of emotional indulgence. I believe that the great tragedy of the American stage is the actor who assumes, thanks to our gross misunderstanding of Stanislavsky, ‘If I feel it, the audience will feel it’.

- - - -



Europeans are, generally speaking, a literary culture. **Americans are an aural culture. Our dominant tradition is evangelical. For us, the sound of words takes precedent over their meaning**. Although we pretend to be at ease with literature on stage like the Europeans are, in fact we are ill at ease. This pretence of ease makes for a false feel in the theatre.

- - - -



I feel that we theatre practitioners today are too timid in our exploitation of the shoulders upon which we stand. Compared to the theatre’s rapid growth and complex adjustments to the innovations, events and movements of the past several centuries, our progress now seems fainthearted. Acting, for example, is the only artistic enterprise in America that has not changed during the past three-quarters of a century. Most acting today looks pretty much the same as it did in the 1930s. Our work has not grown enough and our conventional goals seem too narrow.

- - - -



Our present high-technology lifestyle demands a theatre experience that cannot be satisfied by video and movie screens. I want acting that is poetic and personal, intimate and colossal. I want to encourage the kind of humanity on the stage that demands attention and that expresses who we are and suggests that life is bigger. And it is for this reason that I’m trying to remember and study the past and combine it with the newest ideas in philosophy, science and art. In order to contribute to an artistic explosion I am researching new approaches to acting for the stage that combine vaudeville, operetta, Martha Graham and postmodern dance. I want to find resonant shapes for our present ambiguities. I want to contribute to a field that will engender moments onstage that broaden the definitions of what it means to be human.

- - - -



We enjoy a rich, diverse and unique history and to celebrate it is to remember it. To remember it is to use it. To use it is to be true to who we are.

- - - -



If we can see ourselves in relation to our predecessors and the impulses behind their innovations, our own theatre will necessarily become more intense, poetic, metaphoric, humane and expressive. Our collective dreams will be bigger; the arenas will become more compelling. Perhaps as we remember the past we will find ourselves able to create with more energy and articulation.

- - - -



Art is violent. **==To be decisive is violent.==**

- - - -



When an actor achieves a spontaneous, intuitive, or passionate moment in rehearsal, the director utters the fateful words ‘keep it’, eliminating all other potential solutions.

- - - -



The decisiveness, the cruelty, which has extinguished the spontaneity of the moment, demands that the actor begin an extraordinary work: to resurrect the dead. The actor must now find a new, deeper spontaneity within this set form. And this, to me, is why actors are heroes. They accept this violence and work with it, bringing skill and imagination to the art of repetition.

- - - -



is significant that the French word for rehearsal is repetition.

- - - -



I like to think of staging, or blocking, as a vehicle in which the actors can move and grow. Paradoxically, it is the restrictions, the precision, the exactitude, that allows for the possibility of freedom. The form becomes a container in which the actor can find endless variations and interpretive freedom.

- - - -



For the actor, this necessary violence in creating a role for the theatre is distinctly different from the violence necessary in acting for the camera. In film acting, the actor can afford to do something impulsively without any concern for repeating it endlessly. What is vital for the camera is that the moment be spontaneous and photogenic. In the theatre it must be repeatable.

- - - -



Great performances exude both exactness and a powerful sense of freedom. This freedom can only be found within certain chosen limitations.

- - - -



**==To be articulate in the face of limitations is where the violence sets in==. This act of necessary violence, which at first seems to limit freedom and close down options, in turn opens up many more options and asks for a deeper sense of freedom from the artist.**

- - - -



**Risk is a key ingredient in the act of violence and articulation**. Without embracing the risk, there can be no progress and no adventure. To attempt to perform articulately from a state of imbalance and risk imbues the action with extraordinary energy.

- - - -



‘If you cannot say it,’ wrote the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, ‘point to it/

- - - -



To try to say something in a state of flux even if you do not know the right thing to say is the point. Make an observation. **==To be silent, to avoid the violence of articulation alleviates the risk of failure but at the same time there is also no possibility of advancement==**.

- - - -



In the heat of creation, there is no time for reflection; there is only connection to what is happening. The analysis, the reflection and the criticism belong before and after, never during, the creative act.

- - - -



‘What have we been doing all this time?’ I would ask myself in the light of no agreements, no staging, no trampoline with which the actors might tempt the heights.

- - - -



Censorship is a physical hesitation in the light of a fleeting thought or doubt about how his peers might receive what he is writing, whether or not they will like it or if it will get published. In the light of our hesitations, we must be deeply connected to the act. We must be decisive and intuitive simultaneously.

- - - -



Richard Foreman, perhaps the most intellectual of American directors, said that, for him, creation is one hundred per cent intuitive.

- - - -



As soon as the door closes in rehearsal or as soon as the curtain goes up in performance, there is no time to think or reflect. In these moments of exquisite pressure there is only the intuitive act of articulation within the crisis of action.

- - - -



What is instantly definable is often instantly forgettable. Anything onstage can be asleep when it is overly defined.

- - - -



Victor Schklovsky, the Russian Formalist who undoubtedly influenced Bertolt Brecht with his Four Essays on Formalism written in the 1920s, developed significant theories on the function of art. Everything around us, he wrote, is asleep. The function of art is to awaken what is asleep. How do you awaken what is asleep? According to Schklovsky, you turn it slightly until it awakens.

- - - -



Creativity is first of all an act of destruction. (Pablo Picasso)

- - - -



When you begin a picture, you often make some pretty discoveries. You must be on guard against these. Destroy the thing, do it several times. In each destroying of a beautiful discovery, the artist does not really suppress it, but rather transforms it, condenses it, makes it more substantial. What comes out in the end is the result of the discarded finds. Otherwise, you become your own connoisseur. I sell myself nothing. (Pablo Picasso)

- - - -



An audience in the theatre should be engaged by the events but also slightly distressed about what is happening. The interactions, the words and the actions onstage have to be fresh and untamed and undismissible. Actors are confronted with the enormous task of awakening sleeping clichés. For example, the words ‘I love you’, because they have been said so often, have no meaning unless they are undefined, distorted, turned and offered up anew. Only then might they be fresh and hearable.

- - - -



Another kind of violence is the violence of disagreement. I believe that it is in disagreement that certain truths about the human condition are revealed. It is when images, ideas or people disagree that one senses the truth. These disagreements can be found everywhere in art.

- - - -



Truth, which is an experience and not something easily defined, mostly exists in the space between opposites.

- - - -



One cannot look directly at the truly big human issues any more than one can look directly at the sun. In order to see the sun you look slightly to the side. Between the sun and where you are looking is the perception of the sun. In art and in the theatre we use metaphor as the thing to the side. Through metaphor we see the truth about our condition.

- - - -



To generate the indispensable excitement there must be something at stake, at risk, something momentous and uncertain. A sure thing does not arouse us emotionally.

- - - -



your passion and excitement about something will take you the distance through uncertainty.

- - - -



sat down to wait and watched the young director make a fatal flaw. An actor approached her and asked what he should do with a particular chair. In her haste and nervousness, she said these words: ‘It doesn’t matter.’

- - - -



Something matters to an audience only if you make it matter. If you attend to it, if only for a moment, the commitment of your attention will create the tension of attention.

- - - -



To decide is an act of violence, yet decisiveness and cruelty are part of the collaborative process that the theatre offers. Decisions give birth to limitations which in turn ask for a creative use of the imagination.

- - - -



It’s not about the right idea or even the right decision, rather it is about the quality of decisiveness.

- - - -



The role of attraction and eroticism in the theatre is rarely discussed and yet both are vital ingredients in the creative act and in the dynamics between audiences and the actors. In order to investigate the issues of attraction and eroticism, this chapter follows the archetypical pattern of a passionate relationship. 1 Something or someone stops you in your tracks. 2 You feel ‘drawn’ to it. 3 You sense its energy and power. 4 It disorientates you. 5 You make first contact; it responds. 6 You experience extended intercourse. 7 You are changed irrevocably.

- - - -



I have always been attracted to the challenge of getting to know what I cannot instantly categorize or dismiss, whether an actor’s presence, a painting, a piece of music, or a personal relationship. It is the journey towards the object of attraction that interests me.

- - - -



An authentic work of art embodies intense energy. It demands response. You can either avoid it, shut it out, or meet it and tussle. It contains attractive and complicated energy fields and a logic all its own.

- - - -



In the theatre, the way a show begins has everything to do with the quality of the journey. Do the first moments stop me in my tracks? And how do they do that? As an audience, I can usually feel the promise of a remarkable theatre experience in the very first instants.

- - - -



The best beginnings feel both surprising and inevitable.

- - - -



We are each incomplete. We are drawn towards the other in search of completeness.

- - - -



human beings are attracted, physically and emotionally, towards places where the elements meet: where earth meets water, and water meets air, and air meets fire, etc.

- - - -



The theatre is a place where it is possible to meet one another in an energetic space unmediated by technology. The sensory stimulation allowed in theatre, authorized by its very form, allows the corporeal imagination to exercise itself.

- - - -



Erotic tension between actors and audience is part of the recipe for effective drama. The attraction of the theatre is the promise of a proximity with actors in a place where the corporeal imagination might experience extended intercourse.

- - - -



En route to rehearsal I want the sensation of heading towards an exciting, romantic, turbulent rendezvous **. A rehearsal should feel like a** date **. Both as a director and as an audience member, I** want to find the actors attractive, uncategorizable and undismissable **. The best productions I have directed issue from a rehearsal process charged with erotic interest**.

A great actor, like a great striptease artist, withholds more than she or he shows. Artists, as they mature, come closer to the great wisdom found in the potent combination of physical containment and emotional expansion. Restraint is key. Take the moment and all of its complexities; concentrate it, let it cook, and then contain it. This concentration and restraint generates energy in the actor and interest in the audience. Zeami, the Japanese originator of Noh drama, suggested that the actor should always withhold a certain percentage of her or his passion. … When you feel ten in your heart, express seven…

Art, like life, is understood through experience, not explanations. As theatre artists, we cannot create an experience for an audience; rather, our job is to set up the circumstances in which an experience might occur.

Every great journey begins with disorientation.

- - - -



I know that the attempt to find balance from an imbalanced state is always productive and interesting and yields rich results.

- - - -



Falling in love is disorientating because the boundaries between new lovers are not fixed.

- - - -



A great theatre event is also disorientating because the boundaries between who is giving and who is receiving are not distinct. An exciting artist plays with our expectations and with our memory.

- - - -



I want to use the theatre to question the limits and boundaries of human experience. In every play I direct I want to question my formal, aesthetic, structural and narrative assumptions. I want to allow for necessary personal disorientation in order to make contact with the material and the people involved. And I want to include disorientation as a thread in the fabric of every production.

Quantum physics teaches us that the act of observation alters the thing observed. To observe is to disturb. ‘To observe’ is not a passive verb.

- - - -



Listening to the listening, the actor makes adjustments in the speed of an entrance, the intensity of the first line spoken or the length of a pause. An actor learns when to hold back and when to open up based on the agility of the audience.

- - - -



Attention is a tension.

- - - -



As a director, my biggest contribution to a production, and the only real gift I can offer to an actor, is my attention.

- - - -



narcissism. A director’s job is to be connected to the stage, physically, imaginatively and emotionally.

- - - -



The late William Ball, the founding Artistic Director of ACT/San Francisco, wrote in his book A Sense of Direction that he considers an audience heroic because they choose to spend two hours not thinking about themselves.

- - - -



The rehearsal is a microcosm of the extended intercourse of attention offered by an audience. It is a place of potential rapture. In a rehearsal room, like making love, the outside world is excluded. It is a process of arousal, heightened sensation, alive nerve endings and sudden pinnacles.

- - - -



The primary tool in a creative process is interest. To be true to one’s interest, to pursue it successfully, one’s body is the best barometer. The heart races. The pulse soars. Interest can be your guide. It always points you in the right direction. It defines the quality, energy and content of your work. You cannot feign or fake interest or choose to be interested in something because it is prescribed. It is never prescribed. It is discovered. When you sense this quickening you must act immediately. You must follow that interest and hold on tight.

- - - -



If the interest is genuine and large enough and if it is pursued with tenacity and generosity, the boomerang effect is resounding. Interest returns volley to affect your life and inevitably alter it. You must be available and attentive to the doors that open unexpectedly. You cannot wait. The doors close fast. It will change your life. It will give you adventures you never expected. You must be true to it and it will be true to you.

- - - -



never talk down to an audience. It was immediately clear to me that the experience of theatre was not about us understanding the meaning of the play or the significance of the staging. We were invited into a unique world, an arena that changed everything previously defined.

- - - -



Most of the truly remarkable experiences I’ve had in the theatre have filled me with uncertainty and disorientation.

- - - -



The artist’s responsibility is to bring the potential, the mystery and terror, the trembling, back. James Baldwin wrote, ‘The purpose of art is to lay bare the questions which have been hidden by the answers.’

- - - -



I had to learn to work in trust and not in fear of that terror. I was relieved to find that the theatre is a useful place to concentrate that energy. Out of the almost uncontrollable chaos of life, I could create a place of beauty and a sense of community. In the most terrible depths of doubt and difficulty, I found encouragement and inspiration in collaborating with others. We have been able to create an atmosphere of grace, intensity and love. I have created a refuge for myself, for actors and for audiences through the metaphor that is theatre.

- - - -



I believe that theatre’s function is to remind us of the big human issues to remind us of our terror and our humanity.

- - - -



From cave drawings to ecstatic dances around numberless fires; from Hedda Gabler raising her pistol, to the disintegration of Blanche Dubois, we create shapes that deal with our distress.

- - - -



I have found that theatre that does not channel terror has no energy. We create out of fear, not from a place of security and safety.

- - - -



I am convinced that the most dynamic and thrilling choices are made when there is a trust in the process, in the artists and in the material. The saving grace in one’s work is love, trust and a sense of humour—trust in collaborators and the creative act in rehearsal, love for the art and a sense of humour about the impossible task. These are the elements that bring grace into a rehearsal situation and onto the stage. In the face of terror, beauty is created and hence, grace.

- - - -



We all tremble in terror before the impossibility of beginning. It is important to remember that a director’s work, as with any artist, is intuitive. Many young directors make the big mistake of assuming that directing is about being in control, telling others what to do, having ideas and getting what you ask for. I do not believe that these abilities are the qualities that make a good director or exciting theatre. Directing is about feeling, about being in the room with other people; with actors, with designers with an audience. It is about having a feel for time and space, about breathing, and responding fully to the situation at hand, being able to plunge and encourage a plunge into the unknown at the right moment.

- - - -



I know that I cannot sit down when work is happening on the stage. If I sit, a deadness sets in. I direct from impulses in my body responding to the stage, the actors’ bodies, their inclinations.

- - - -



When I am lost in rehearsal, when I am stymied and have no idea what to do next or how to solve a problem, I know that this is the moment to make a leap.

- - - -

For me, the essential aspect of a given work is its vitality. This vitality, or energy, is a reflection of the artist’s courageousness in the face of her or his own terror. The creation of art is not an escape from life but a penetration into it.

- - - -

Americans are plagued with the disease of agreement. In the theatre, we often presume that collaboration means agreement. I believe that too much agreement creates productions with no vitality, no dialectic, no truth.

- - - -

Perhaps we can stop trying so hard to be innovative and original; rather, our charge is to receive tradition and utilize the containers we inherit by filling them with our own wakefulness. The boundaries of these containers, their limits, can serve to magnify the experience of entering them.

- - - -

Because we can walk and talk, we assume that we can act. But an actor actually has to reinvent walking and talking to be able to perform those actions effectively upon the stage.

- - - -

The actor must ‘put a fire’ under these clichés in order to bring them to life.

- - - -

I believe that it is better to set the exterior (the form, the action) and allow the interior (the quality of being, the ever-altering emotional landscape) freedom to move and change in every repetition.

- - - -

The lines between actors on the stage should never go slack.

- - - -

When approaching stereotype as an ally, you do not embrace a stereotype in order to hold it rigid; rather, you burn through it, undefining it and allowing human experience to perform its alchemy.

- - - -

Culture is invasive and fluid. It moves through the air and saturates human experience.

- - - -

the theatre we reach out and touch the past through literature, history and memory so that we might receive and relive significant and relevant human questions in the present and then pass them on to future generations.

- - - -

If your work does not sufficiently embarrass you, then very likely no one will be touched by it.

- - - -

Embarrassment is a teacher. A good actor risks embarrassment in every moment. There is nothing more thrilling than to be in rehearsal with an actor who is willing to set foot into embarrassing territory. The uneasiness keeps the lines tight. If you try to avoid being embarrassed by what you do, nothing will happen because the territory remains safe and unexposed. Embarrassment engenders a glow and a presence and a dissolving of habit.
**Note:** I call this vulnerability. But, very similar.

- - - -

If I adopt the attitude that the project is an adventure larger than anything I might imagine, an entity that will challenge me to find an instinctual path through it, the project will be allowed its proper magnitude.

- - - -

The enemy of art is assumption: the assumption that you know what you are doing, the assumption that you know how to walk and how to talk, the assumption that what you ‘mean’ will mean the same thing to those who receive it.

- - - -

A director cannot hide from an audience because intentions are always visible, palpable. An audience senses your attitude towards them. They smell your fright or condescension. They know instinctively that you want only to impress or conquer. They sense your engagement or lack of it. These qualities live in your body and are visible in your work. You must have a reason to do what it is you do because these reasons are felt by anyone who comes in contact with your work. It matters how you treat people, how you take responsibility in a crisis, what values you develop, your politics, what you read, how you speak and even which words you choose. You cannot hide.

- - - -

You cannot fake interest. It must be genuine. Interest is your engine and it determines the lengths to which you will travel in the heat of engagement.

- - - -

Be prepared to leap at the appropriate moment and you will never know when the moment will be appropriate. The door opens and you must go through it with no consideration for the consequences. You leap. But you must also accept that the leap itself does not guarantee anything. And it does not mitigate the embarrassment; rather, it heightens it.

- - - -

It is not the director’s responsibility to produce results but, rather, to create the circumstances in which something might happen.

- - - -

To arrive at a place where something sufficiently embarrassing can happen, I place my attention on the circumstances of the rehearsal. I attend to the quality of the room, including punctuality, lack of clutter and cleanliness.

- - - -

To enter paradise you usually have to go through the back door

- - - -

How do you get out of your own way? First, accept the paradox that theatre is artifice yet our search is for authenticity—art, as Picasso said, is the lie that tells the truth. Despite the artifice we search for spontaneity and freedom. But to enter that paradise, you cannot enter through the front gates; you must go around to the back door.

- - - -

I have found that, creatively, imbalance is more fruitful than stability.

- - - -

If there is no such thing as an accident and everything is fodder and happens for a reason, then accidents can be channelled into the shape of a production. And these shapes contain energy, memory and necessary ambiguity.

- - - -

If your work is too controlled, it has no life. If it is too chaotic, no one can see or hear it.

In every creative process there comes the moment where you have to stop worrying about whether or not you know enough about the subject you’ve been studying.

- - - -

Academic art simply validates the research. It does not challenge it.

- - - -

These experiences taught me to appreciate the resistances that life offers and to recognize them as an ally. There will always be resistances and obstacles no matter what the situation. Whether at a huge subsidized theatre or a tiny community theatre, in a city or in the countryside, something or someone will always present resistance. The question becomes: how can you use the difficulties and obstacles to help rather than discourage expression?

- - - -

If there are not enough obstacles in a given process, the result can lack rigour and depth.

- - - -

Resistance heightens and magnifies the effort. Meeting a resistance, confronting an obstacle, or overcoming a difficulty always demands creativity and intuition. In the heat of the conflict, you have to call on new reserves of energy and imagination. You develop your muscles in the act of overcoming resistance—your artist muscles. Like a dancer, you have to practise regularly to keep up muscularity. The magnitude of the resistances you choose to engage determines the progression and depth of your work. The larger the obstacles, the more you will transform in the effort.

- - - -

Try not to think of anything as a problem. Start with a forgiving relationship to laziness and impatience and cultivate a sense of humour about them both. And then trick them. Start a task or an activity before you are ready or after you are ‘not ready’.

- - - -

It is natural and human to seek union and restore balance from the imbalance of engagement with discord. Recite an entire Shakespeare soliloquy from a physical state of imbalance. In the attempt to maintain equilibrium and not topple over while you speak, every part of your being reaches out for balance, harmony and union. This struggle is positive and productive. Suddenly the body speaks with astonishing clarity and necessity. The struggle requires precision and articulation.
**Note:** Like Taibi's exercise to say the speech on a bucket.

- - - -

Art is a defiance of death. There will never be enough encouragement and support and we are all going to die. So why bother? Why put so much effort into a liminal activity? Why should we struggle so hard with a business that is at its heart only artifice?

- - - -

Utopia is now. The act of making theatre is already utopian because art is an act of resistance against circumstances. If you are making theatre now, you have already successfully achieved utopia.

- - - -

Why not choose a play that is just beyond your reach? The reach is what changes you and gives your work energy and vitality.

- - - -

Allow me to propose a few suggestions about how to handle the natural resistances that your circumstances might offer. Do not assume that you have to have some prescribed conditions to do your best work. Do not wait Do not wait for enough time or money to accomplish what you think you have in mind. Work with what you have right now. Work with the people around you right now. Work with the architecture you see around you right now. Do not wait for what you assume is the appropriate, stress-free environment in which to generate expression. Do not wait for maturity or insight or wisdom. Do not wait till you are sure that you know what you are doing. Do not wait until you have enough technique. What you do now, what you make of your present circumstances will determine the quality and scope of your future endeavours. And, at the same time, be patient.
