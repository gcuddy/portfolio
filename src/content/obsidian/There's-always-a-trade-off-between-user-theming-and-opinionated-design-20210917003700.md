Giving users power to customize the design of software and use their own skins and themes inherently gives software a sense of personality, since the user can endow it with a mark of their ownership.

But it comes with trade-offs, of course. An opinionated, carefully chosen design could go down the drain — along with any accessibility considerations that go along with that.

Look at the mess people make out of Obsidian, for instance. In this case, the Minimal theme seems to be the best of the bunch in terms of design. But many make the app absolutely horrendous to look at — and give a sense that this is an app with poor design choices, which can affect people's experience of the app.

On the other side, you have Apple’s overly careful consideration of how to allow users to customize their home screens. Home screen widgets, while fun, are still a very “sanitized” version of user customization.
