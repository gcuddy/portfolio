From capitalist realism: 
> After all, and as Žižek has provocatively pointed out, ==anti-capitalism is widely disseminated in capitalism==. Time after time, the villain in Hollywood films will turn out to be the ‘evil corporation’. Far from undermining capitalist realism, this gestural anti-capitalism actually reinforces it.

Nothing late capitalism loves more than to subsume critiques of capitalism.

Perhaps roots of this comes from genesis of [[noir]], as discusssed in [[davis1992 City of Quartz]]: a genre that comes from exposing underbelly of capitalism from within Hollywood rot.

But we've seen this lately with rise of "eat the rich" content and even stuff like Andor on Disney+.
