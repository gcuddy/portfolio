## Resist using the term "user" in computing contexts

> I resist using the word “user” in most contexts because it implies things we may not intend (drug users come to mind). In the context of human-computer interactions, ==“user” implies a power relationship and a kind of experience that tends to mischaracterize both technology and people==. When we began to define human-computer interaction back in the 1970s and 1980s, the term “user” be- came quickly over-generalized. A person isn’t typically defined as a “user” of the New York Times (unless you are house-breaking the dog) or of an automobile or a doctor. Over the years, I have exhorted my students not to use “user” unless it’s really the correct word. For example, the “user” of a computer game is better characterized as a “player”; the “user” of an e-book is a “reader.” Char Davies has called participants in VR experiences “immersants.” Because this book covers a wide variety of human-computer interactions, I have used the word “==interactor==” as a general term, although I use “user” when I really mean it!
