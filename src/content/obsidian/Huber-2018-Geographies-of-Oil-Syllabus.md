**Course Description** 

Oil is often imagined to contain incredible powers. It is fuels our economy; it’s a magical generator of wealth and prosperity. On the other hand, it is seen as a “curse” that inhibits democracy and causes poverty, and desire for oil is claimed to drive geopolitical conflict and war. If oil runs out, we are told industrial civilization will collapse. We understand that oil is fundamental to society, economics, and politics, but oil is also profoundly _geographical_.  It only exists in particular local places, and its underground state makes knowledge about its whereabouts highly contentious. Its importance as a _global_ commodity ensures that (geo)political groups situated at diverse geographical scales (local, national, global) will struggle over oil control and profit. Once it is extracted it must be transported through vast geographical networks of pipelines, ocean tankers, and refineries. Once it is refined it serves particular uses which themselves produce geographies (e.g., in the U.S., cheap gasoline is a critical basis for suburban sprawl and the reliance on auto-transport).  Oil is also central to geographical concerns with the environment.  Its extraction leads to water contamination. Refining consumes tremendous amounts of energy and water and produces toxic pollution. The combustion of motor fuel produces smog and air quality problems.  Throughout oil’s global travels it also produces greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. 

  

In this course, we will use the topic of oil to explore the concerns of human geography with society, space, and the natural environment.  By learning about oil we will cover themes and concepts important to environmental, political, cultural, economic and urban geography. We will also explore oil in diverse geographical contexts including Texas, Venezuela, and Nigeria. 

  

  

  

**COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES**

- Explore and critically reflect on geographic issues, concepts, and debates.
- Identify, locate, evaluate, use, and share information as it pertains to geography.
- Articulate what a geographic perspective brings to our understandings of a changing world and its human and environmental dynamics. 
- Describe and explain the changing relationship between humans and the environment and its different form over time and across space.
- Describe and explain the dynamic relationship between people and places, and among places, over time and across space and scales. 

**REQUIRED TEXT** 

Timothy Mitchell. _Carbon Democracy: Political Power in the Age of Oil_ (London: Verso, 2011) [[𖠫 Carbon Democracy - Timothy Mitchell|*]]

  

Almost everything you read for this course will be posted under “content” on blackboard. Please match the topic for the day on the syllabus with the appropriate folder. We will read one book in the middle of the semester.

  

**ASSIGNMENTS** 

  

Quizzes (5%)

There will be three quizzes throughout the semester totaling 5% of your final grade. These are basically meant to check your “pulse” in terms of how invested you are in class materials. The quizzes will not only test the reading due on that particular day, but they might ask what was covered in the previous day’s lecture. They also are meant to test your ability to come to class on time. There will be a short grace period, but if you are excessively late on a quiz day you lose the points.

  

**QUIZ MAKEUP AND LATE POLICY**

If you **ever** need to miss class for any reason please email me and explain the reason **before class starts**. If there is a quiz on that particular day, and you notify me with a legitimate absence, you will have the opportunity to make up the quiz. **If you fail to notify me of an absence on a quiz day you will lose points. If you are LATE to class, you will not be able to take the quiz.** The quizzes are meant to “test” both the reading _and_ the basics of attendance and timely arrival to class. 

  

Participation (10%) 

This class is large and will have limited discussion. However, I will keep track of attendance and monitor classroom contributions.

Found Object (5%)

Every class day will begin with two or three of you presenting a 2-3 minute “found object” on oil and society. This could be a newspaper article, television/movie clip, or any other cultural image/media object that you can show/summarize to the class.  You will be graded on the relevance of the “object” to class themes and your presentation effectiveness.

  

Mini-Exam (10%)

The goal of this exam is to make sure students are engaged and learning material early in the semester (the exam will be on September 18th). Unlike the two major exams, this one will only last 20 minutes. 

Essays (3 total: 5% +10%+ 15%=30%) 

There are three essays in this class. Each essay increases in length and percentage of your grade. If you improve your writing/analysis as the semester goes on your grade will show it. The final paper will entail a synthetic evaluation of the topic of oil using course materials throughout the semester. The prompts will be handed out at least two weeks ahead of time for the first two papers and 3 weeks for the final paper. 

  

Exams (2 Exams: 20% each)

There will be two exams in the semester. These exams are meant to test your knowledge of the concepts and empirical material on oil covered in class lecture. 

**EVALUATION** 

Mini-Exam 10% A (93-100) C+ (77-79)

Quizzes 5% A- (90-92) C (73-76)

Overall Participation 10% B+ (87-89) C- (70-72)

Found Object 5% B (83-86) D (60-69)

Essays (3) 30% B- (80-82) F (0-59)

Exams (2) 40%

Total: 100%

  

**STATEMENT ON ADD/DROP POLICY**

It is the policy of the Geography Department that students must obtain FIRST the signature of the instructor and THEN the signature of the department chair if they wish to drop or withdraw from this course.

  

  

**SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY POLICIES**

Students should review the University’s policies regarding: Diversity and Disability https://www.syracuse.edu/life/accessibilitydiversity/; the Religious Observances Notification and Policyhttp://supolicies.syr.edu/studs/religious_observance.htm; and Orange SUccess - http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/ 

  

**DISABILITY-RELATED ACCOMMODATIONS**

If you believe that you need academic adjustments (accommodations) for a disability, please contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS), visit the ODS website– http://disabilityservices.syr.edu, located in Room 309 of 804 University Avenue, or call (315) 443-4498 or TDD: (315) 443-1371 for an appointment to discuss your needs and the process for requesting academic adjustments. ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic adjustments and will issue students with documented Disabilities Accommodation Authorization Letters, as appropriate. Since academic adjustments may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon as possible. 

  

**ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY**

Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy defines our expectations for academic honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should understand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The policy governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of participation in class activities. The policy also prohibits students from submitting the same work in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance from both instructors. Under the policy, students found in violation are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered as described in the Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric. SU students are required to read an online summary of the University’s academic integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre-term check-in on MySlice.
