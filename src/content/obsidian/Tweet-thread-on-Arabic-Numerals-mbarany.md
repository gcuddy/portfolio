"Though Arabic numerals were capable of both [recording and calculation] they were not optimal for either one." [@jotis13](https://twitter.com/jotis13) sharing her fantastic project on Early Modern English numeracy with [@maanow](https://twitter.com/maanow) [@HOMSIGMAA](https://twitter.com/HOMSIGMAA)

Seven common systems of numbers in early modern England, per [@jotis13](https://twitter.com/jotis13) [@HOMSIGMAA](https://twitter.com/HOMSIGMAA) 
Performative: spoken, gestures
Object: counters, tally sticks (best for recording)
Written: number words, Roman and Arabic numerals

Emphasis on financial mathematics and mix-base currencies and measures had a big effect on what kinds of numbering were most useful and effective in practical settings. "Tallies were effectively equivalent to money" well into 18th century. [@jotis13](https://twitter.com/jotis13) [@HOMSIGMAA](https://twitter.com/HOMSIGMAA)

.[@jotis13](https://twitter.com/jotis13) stresses the difficulty of altering tally sticks, number words, and Roman numerals for their appeal in number recording.

As her efforts to OCR early modern printed numbers underscored, Arabic numerals are easy to tamper with and also to get wrong accidentally. Why risk it with important financial numbers? [@jotis13](https://twitter.com/jotis13) [@HOMSIGMAA](https://twitter.com/HOMSIGMAA)

Really gives the lie to just-so stories about Fibonacci and the supposed revolutionary effects of Arabic notation in early modern Europe.

.[@jotis13](https://twitter.com/jotis13) also notes something that came up in a recent thread of mine, that early modern English authors often used both Roman and Arabic numerals for different purposes in books [twitter.com/MBarany/statusâ€¦](https://twitter.com/MBarany/status/1386322441027428363?s=20)

> The text shows this by distinguishing between the numerals (10, 15, etc) and the numbers they represent in a calculation (ten or x, fifteen or xv, etc). Roman numerals, which were more familiar to readers, are allowed to be numbers themselves, but not the newer numerals. 6/

Counters on counting boards had all the nice features of Arabic numerals *and so much more*, including easier to adapt for mixed-base currency systems, and so much more accurate. [@jotis13](https://twitter.com/jotis13) [@HOMSIGMAA](https://twitter.com/HOMSIGMAA)

Hadn't heard [@jotis13](https://twitter.com/jotis13) 's hypothesis that the folks on the right are probably writing on the table with chalk. Makes sense!

This talk has all the close reading of early modern marginalia you love to see. Dot notation in marginalia reflected counting board calculation. "Marginalia were the surest indication of calculation methods." [@jotis13](https://twitter.com/jotis13) [@HOMSIGMAA](https://twitter.com/HOMSIGMAA)
