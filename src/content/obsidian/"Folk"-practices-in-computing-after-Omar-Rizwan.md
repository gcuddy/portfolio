In the real world, people don't use technology in the way we'd necessarily expect, or how it was "intended" to be used. For instance, the ubiquity of taking screenshots could be viewed as a "folk" practice in computing. It's not really the "correct" way to capture text, but we use it anyway. We take screenshots on screenshots on screenshots, TikTok appears on Twitter, etc. 

(â†¯ Side note: not sure about appropriate use of word "folk" here which is why I keep putting it in quotes. Weary of [[appropriation|appropriating]].)

Often this involves "lossy" ways of replicating something in computing. Taking screenshots isn't a lossless way of representing a web page (saving it would be). Or on the subway, [people take a picture of the map](https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1113157229207740416) instead of downloading an app. There's something very important to leaning into how people use computers *in practice*, not just *in theory*.
