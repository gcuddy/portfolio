# Reading ðŸ“š

A place to track big reading projects etc. A library.

Big literary projects I want to do:

Now:
- [[read Marx's capital]]
Overarching themes: leftism
theory
continental philosophy
pyschoanalysis

Later:
- [[Read Hegel]]
- Read [[Eric Hobsbawm]] history textbook series
- Read Mike Davis
