First "coined" by Neal Stephenson in Snow Crash

The "next internet" as some (like Zuckerberg) have dubbed it. A "persistent, synchronous environment" where we can be together.

Frequently used in conjunction with language such as "embodied" and "physicality" - [[Internet and Physical Space]], [[The Metaverse represents an embodied, physical internet — but at what cost?]]

See: first introduced to me by Matthew Ball piece: [[The Metaverse What It Is, Where to Find It, Who Will Build It, and Fortnite — Matthew Ball]]

he also has a ridiculous 9-part primer on the Metaverse which I have not yet read - https://www.matthewball.vc/the-metaverse-primer

It does seem like Mark Zuckerberg is *literally* using the language I read in Ball's piece, so either these companies are taking from Ball's pieces or Ball is highly connected with these companies.

right now those companies seem to be:

* [[Facebook]]
* [[Epic Games]] (creator of [[Fortnite]])
