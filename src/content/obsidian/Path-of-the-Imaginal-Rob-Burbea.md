## Energy Body Instructions 1
### Three Types of Mindfulness of body

* Mindfulness of *sensations*
	* By far the most common in Insight tradition
	* EG. warmth, coolness, pressure in hand; raisin in mouth - sensations of taste
* Mindfulness of *materiality of the body*
	* Contemplating body parts: teeth, face, etc.
	* **Four elements** and presence in body
		* Reverence and holiness for four elements
	* Less direct than sensations: Inlcudes imaginations and conceptions of body
		* **Contemplation** of body
	* "Deconstruction" of body
	*
### **Mindfulness of *energy body***

*This is the one we're going to focus on
* A way of experiencing the body
* **Experience**
* The whole space - little bit bigger than physical body
	* Includes space underneath bum, between floor and chair - a whole oval

## Why?

* Cultivate [[samadhi]]  (pali/sanskrit)
	* Usually translated as "concentration" - but not quite that
		* Not simply **focus/concentration/steadiness** (though it is that too), but an ***awareness* and *sensititivty* to this whole body space**
		* Energization, restfulness, brightness permeate samadhi
			* Lovely space to hang out, but also good for mind
	* Samadhi has infinitely deep potential, a deepening resource of being
		* Pays off in all sorts of ways in practice + life
* General deepening/sensitivity to energy body and feel of energy body
	* That sensitivity to energy body forms awareness of emotion, Enables us to work skillfully with energies and emotions
	* Basis of imaginal practice
		* Allows us to pick up *resonances* of different images
		* Discern which images are helpful, which aren't
		* **If not in touch with energy body, it's ==daydreaming==**
* If you have lots of time (at home), make sure to develop samadhi
* Tending to body energies and sense of well-being
	* Without grasping, without getting tight
		* **Be *playful* and *creative* with experience of energy body**

24:10 Guided Meditation - tending to energy body
ends at 1:07:45
Total: ~ 43 minute
	* Went through a bunch of different possibilities with the energy body. I quitee enjoyed the ones that focus around *centering*, specifically with having the enregy bdody being centered in a place in the body, and having the breath center from a particular place in the body as well. I also liked letting go of the breatha nd working with the body as a body of light -- played with golden and red colors. And all that being cradled, almost, in the whole energy body space -- really filling that space and stretching the awareness with bright mindfulness.
	* The actual stretching of the energy body is, for me, a challenge.

### Guided Meditation Instructions

Ways of working with [[energy body]]:
+ Awareness of energy body: tone, texture, vibration, feel, energy
	+ Centering awareness in heart, belly, etc
+ If wanting to work with the [[breath]] (See: [[Working with the breath in meditation]]): [[make the breath long]], tune into whole enregy space expand/contract, or energization/relxatation. how that permeates space/runs in channels. whatever you find useful to tune into in terms of feeling the energy of th space with each in/out breath
	+ Also can have the breath centered in certain areas of the body - feeling the energy there. imaginging it but also how it feels energetically. and always asking: **what kind of breath feels best?**
+ cam also use imagination, not breath: lines of energy, extending through body and legs. can play with it. also energy body as amoprhous cloud of light. can combine with breath. also could imagine contoured body of light.

key is to EXPERIMENT with all this

## Energy, Image, Emotion

### Part 1

On developing [[samadhi]]: "We’re not aiming to always be in some state of pleasant well-being, open, harmonized energy. A) I think that’s probably relatively impossible, and B) for something to be a resource, for the samadhi and the well-being of that to be a resource, a deep, powerful, potent resource in our life, it’s not that it needs to be there all the time. Absolutely not. It needs to be there often enough. Often enough that we can have access to it, dip in and out of it, not always"

Anything goes with [[energy body]]: "Regarding the direction, the intended direction of samadhi at times, it’s very creative, very playful. Really anything goes that helps you get in touch with that energy body, and just helps to kind of shape it or open it up to something that feels comfortable, easeful, nice, relatively pleasant, maybe quite pleasant."

>  Anything goes, but the intention for the samadhi, the directionality, is really to gently cultivate, gently tend to a sense of well-being of the energy body. And eventually seeing if that sense of well-being can actually spread and permeate, as the awareness does, the whole space.

#### Dealing with discomfort

1. Open out awareness when it's shrunk
2. Gently direct attention/sit with awareness where there's more "okayness" somewhere, rather than getting dragged into discomfort
3. Imagine breath/breath energy moving freely through discomfort
4. Imagine breath or energy coming in and out of discomfort
5. Imagine [[metta]] originating from center of discomfort, or flowing from there
6. Imagine bright light centered in discomfort, include whole body so light is radiating through the body from that point
7. Bring light and attention to discomfort, with bg awareness of whole body. **Fully allow it**.
8. Use imagination to put discomfort in body in connection with some sense of comfort/pleasure. Surround discomfort with something more comfortable, holding/cradling it. "And perhaps that more comfortable energy, the softer, warmer energy, can sort of lap against, like gentle waves, perhaps in a lake, lapping against a jagged rock, and just lapping and lapping. Perhaps that’s the breath, and the breath can feel, at times, itself quite soft or gentle or soothing or pleasant or healing, and that energy quality of the breath, perhaps, is like gentle waves lapping against what’s uncomfortable"
	1. You can even imagine there's a channel connecting the two areas - uncomfortable in throat but comfortable in belly, just imagine they're connected
	2. Important thing: be playful and creative
9. If there's pleasantness and well-being, really focus on it and include it. Open up body to include it? Or dissolve into it? Reslish in it? **Allow** oneself to enjoy what feels good.

#### Practice possibilities

We don't have to create inner critic or ego around developing samadhi. It's about kindness to the self, like arranging pillows or running a bath and perhaps just asking if you want the bath warmer.

Possiblities:

1. Intention of samadhi: nourhisng well-being in the energy body.
2. **Attention to the emotions in the energy body as they manifest** without intention to move towards what's pleasant
	1. This is part of just regular emotional awareness as well, being able to work skillfully with our emotional life.

On that point: **where are we going with our emotional life as practitioners?** Some aspects:

1. Want to be able to feel our emotions and to be **sensitive** to our emotions, and all the nuances of that. Alive and in touch with the richness, range, depth, and also subtleties and nuances of our heart
2. Want to be able to handle and tolerate what comes through our heart: difficult and beautiful. Both personal life and globally, holding emotions that are much larger than our own lives, in service of the planet.
3. "We're in the business of cultivating beautiful qualities of heart, as the Buddha might say, positive emotions, joy, and compassion, and love, and equanimity, and appreciation, and gratitude, all these beautiful qualities of heart, generosity, et cetera." Discerning what's *fruitful*, and defuse what's not useful.
	1. We're also in the business of learning to let go of emotions that are not useful. This is NOT the same thing as letting go of what is unpleasant. "what feels a little bit unpleasant may be fruitful if we can find the right relationship with it.
4. A sensitivity to the emotions forms part of imaginal practice and all of meditation.
5. An understanding of emotions: personal patterns and habits - what do I keep fabricating? But more broadly: want to understand **dependent arising** of emotions: what gives rise to an emotion?
