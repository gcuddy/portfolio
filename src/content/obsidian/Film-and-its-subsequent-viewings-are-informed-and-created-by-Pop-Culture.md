While theater is created in the present (see [[Theater is created with a spontaneous web of conditions, ala dependent arising in Buddhism]]) — informed by culture, but also by the presence in the room — film is inherently created in the past and then viewed in the present.

The act of creation that comes from film is present in the actual **film viewing**.
