#2022/02/19 20220219000305

Four note types listed here: [[2022-02-18 night notes#^c062f8]], but still figuring out the layers above/aside:

* index
* hub
* moc
* list/outline
* noun
* defintion

davecan levels:

1. notes
2. outlines/lists - specific
3. topic clusters - broader
4. mocs

does the topic cluster get broken into smaller/bigger hubs?

examples:

> 1. Individual notes on note taking methods, principles, ideas, etc
> 2. Two list notes: `List of note taking principles` and `List of note taking methods` collecting the notes from #1 in various ways
> 3. Topic clusters: one on Zettelkasten method, one on note taking systems in general, etc, each linking to items from #1 and #2 as appropriate
> 4. A few MOCs: I don’t have a “note taking MOC” but I do have one titled `Reasoning and Learning MOC` which includes a section on knowledge digestion and note making, containing links to various items from #1 - #3 as appropriate

to incorporate: [[davecan on MOCs]] and his 4 layers of notes

* Ephemeral/fleeting notes
  * Daily working log
  * Timestamped notes

* Notes tagged inbox - prompts and incomplete notes

* Nouns
  * Log notes - accumulating ephemeral observations (can be just done with backlinks, e.g. [[tools for thought]] or [[Tinkering ideas]])
  * "categories"/interests like [[woodworking]]
  * Literature: [[2021 letter, Dan Wang]]
  * People: [[Cassidy Hammond]] (maybe unicode to denote)
  * Organization

* Outlines, indexes, mocs
  * e.g. [[Digital and Physical (Analog) Prime]]

* to place: super-structures/bigger mocs? do those use ☵ or something?
  * e.g. [[☵ Hearth]]

* Evergreen notes - with timestamp affixed
  * tagged e
  * Stubs defined through backlinks
  * Terms of art
  * Narrow, declarative notes
  * Higher-level apis

* Special:
  * ## Notes that are "views"/inboxes ⧉ usually holding a dataview query

* Ephemeral/fleeting notes - in daily working log, in fleeting notes that are also timestamped

* Prompts and incomplete notes in writing inbox

* Evergreen notes

* Outline notes

* Proper noun notes
  * Literature
  * People
  * organization
