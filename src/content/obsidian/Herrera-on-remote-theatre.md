Herrera on remote theatre
                    
- In defense of remote theatre
- It will be a subset of theatrical practice
- Long academic thought of "what theatre is"
- Book: liveness.
- Liveness is the fetishized feature of theatre
- Remote theatre as "**spatial modifier**"
- **False opposition**, liveness versus digital
- digital theatre that is not quite theatre, not quite film
- How can we activate a sense of wonder? Ie **emotionally durable design**? (Digital playlists and mixtapes)
- Questions of recording vs liveness
- Is this a question of form? Or just where we stock the item at the grocery store?
- Screen - emotionally durable? No souvenir, no physical object 
- How to mark senee of **shared time**. What will the *artifact* be! (Generally that is the memory...)
- But what is the frame? Not just a blur in the mediated digital experience
- How can remote theatre complement theatre as an accessible, potentially non scarce form? (Should we put all eggs in scarcity basket)
- How can this become a meaningful social practice? Beyond just aesthetics, is this just luminal something or something that is beyond?
