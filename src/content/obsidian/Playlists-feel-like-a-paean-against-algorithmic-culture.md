Digital playlists, when lovingly curated and shared with care (such as with Sam Valenti IV's [[Herb Sundays]] newsletter), do have an emotional effect. That is — a human assembled these songs in a particular order. And they're saying something with how they did that: an emotion, a vibe, a mood. There's an imaginative leap that goes beyond passively consuming songs in an algorithmic haze.

They don't achieve the same tactile, emotional connection as physical mixtapes, though — [[The mixtape was a means of asynchronous emotional communication 20220211233730]]. But they, even in bastardized form, achieve something. Perhaps it's *because* finding a good Sdotify playlist feels like going undercover amidst the algo.

They maybe don't achieve all the perceived qualities of [[Emotionally durable design]], but they are close.

The idea of someone choosing these songs for me is also perhaps why I enjoy listening to radio more and more (see:: [[Listening to the radio as a collective background live experience]]).

Playlists also act as a form of [[curation]]. Curation is, in a sense, a form of [[criticism]] (->:: [[criticism as a form of art]]).
