Great podcast on [[Internal Family Systems]] with[[Frank Anderson, MD]]

**Everyone has multiplicity, and it's completely normal**

parts are not pathology, **parts take on extreme roles**. 

everyone has self energy. does not need to be cultivated - but people may not access to it. 


everyone has **little people in them**. Everyone has them. Like INSIDE OUT.  Express in various ways: emotions, etc

**Every part wants something positive for us**. This is very hard to understand. Even suicidal, cutting, heroin - they want what's best. IFS gets curious about them. There's also constant multiplicity - a suicidal person has a part that wants to die, and a part that doesn't.

- ==**Parts in IFS**==:
	- **Protectors**
		- **Managers**
			- Preventing us from feeling pain
		- **Firefighters**
			- Extreme roles, when something happens to bring up pain they react
			- Parts take on extreme roles based on environment they're in (often from family)
	- **Exiles**
		- The parts of us that are in pain
		- The parts that carry the trauma
			- Hold pain of experience, stuck at that time
				- Protectors try to rescue us from this
- Don't move forward until the protective parts give permission
- Self-Energy
	- A state of being
	- Self is different than parts
		- Self-energy is
			- Calm
			- Curious
			- Compassionate
			- Open
			- Loving
		- Self is state of being at essence
		- Comes from source
			- God
			- Love
			- Nature
		- once self holds it, there can be a release of pain



- Trauma is overwhelming by definition
	- Parts don't like the self
		- Parts experience the self as abandoning them
	- Part of healing trauma is repairing parts-self relationship


- We're here to learn and grow from our adversity
	- We can heal from our trauma
	- Nobody is adversity free




IFS as a "paradigm for living"
