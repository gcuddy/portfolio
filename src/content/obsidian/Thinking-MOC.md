> Thinking can be its own space.

The first stop is the [[Notebox üóÉÔ∏è]].  There we can do what's easy:  bouncing from note to note, developing them in a special way to maintain [[Flow State]]. I keep the [[Concepts MOC]] handy because I believe a handful of core concepts influence our entire worldview in disproportionately powerful ways. These notes help me make leaps of insights while connecting new ideas to existing concepts.

I'm a big believing in the power of prompts. A couple good prompts is enough to kickstart my thinking. That's why I have so many notes on prompts such as "The NoMa Method", the "7 C's", and even the "11 C's". But for the LYT Kit, I'll just point you towards [[Refraction Thinking]] and [[Levels of Magnification]].
