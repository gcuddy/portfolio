When we're using [[linked notes]] or [[Zettelkasten]], it can be incredibly useful to have some sort of "higher order" note that lets you see the forest from the trees.

These go by many different names: Outlines, Hubs, Index, Maps of Content (MOC), Elephant Path ([[Ton Zijlstra (Zylstra)]]), Wayfinder... to name a few.

Another way of thinking about them is as top-down vs bottom up, or as davecan puts it, the difference between a map view and first person in a FPS

An outstanding question: How do question notes fit in?
