* ## Shortcuts on iOS for contexts
  * But you get too many, so... Choose from menu to:
    * open app to place
    * Create omnifocus project/template
    * Open specific docs
    * Append text to document
* Alfred as basis for automation on Mac
* DevonThink creates UUID for EVERYTHING you put in it (Finder doesn't do this) - so that unlocks a lot
  * Put a lot of stuff into devonthink and that solves some things
* Hook app is also excellent, and david uses
  * Mac only, so that gives you limitations...
* Keyboard Maestro is the real thing though
  * Eventually you will have too many... 	so use Conflict Palettes for choosing
    * eg CMD+R to talk to Relay people
    * Every thing related to Macsparky gets control-option-command-m - and then you have conflict palettes
  * Command + Option + Control + M, P, L
    * conflict pal
    * Macsparky, personal, lawyers
  * Examples:
    * Banking page
    * Pages for Roles in Life - RF goes to Father page
  * Keyboard Maestro - Fiel d guide
* Advanced: chaining things together
  * Time tracking shortcuts with doing work
  * Dark Noise + Work
  * Watch faces - different color
  * Combining with PKM
    * Mission Control Dock on big projects
