- 2022-10-15 02:31 WITI had a good piece about herb Sundays recently: https://whyisthisinteresting.substack.com/p/the-herb-sundays-edition (related: WITI rules, I should put it in the "core" newsletter rotation). But this makes me think about the "lost art of the playlist", and that paper I have notes on about digital playlists/mixtapes and [[Emotionally durable design]]: [[@fenby-hulse2016RethinkingDigitalPlaylist]].

Going to keep track of this state of music, as I've been thinking a lot about it — there was that guardian article recently about how many of us have seemingly "abandoned" music, something that 10 years ago would have seemed unthinkable. But trying to reclaim that!  ^a500d4
