> - there is only one fundamental definition of capitalism. ==Capitalism is a historical form of life in which wage labor is the foundation of social wealth==. We live in a global capitalist world because all of us depend for our survival on the social wealth generated by wage labor. In order to generate wealth through the social form of the wage relation, ==we must exploit labor time and consume commodities that are made for profit==. The production of all our goods and services is mediated by the social form of wage labor, since ==even how much free time we have to produce goods or services for nonprofit depends on the wage we receive or the capital we have==. Moreover, the production of the capital wealth that is distributed in the form of wages requires that there is a ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù of value in the economy, which is possible only if we continue to exploit and commodify our lives for the sake of profit. Under capitalism our collective spiritual cause‚Äîthat for the sake of which we labor‚Äîis profit. ([Location¬†6527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072MXPYQB&location=6527))
