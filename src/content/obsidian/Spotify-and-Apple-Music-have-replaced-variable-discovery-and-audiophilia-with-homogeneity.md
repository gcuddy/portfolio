A friend recently asked me on a  walk what sort of music I was into these days. I, unfortunately, responded with an essay-length answer.

The truth is: I don't know anymore. And that is different than past me. Since music listening has become dominated by services like Spotify or Apple Music, I've become more indifferent, unsure about new music. I feel less passion, less ownership over new music.

Spotify led to muzak, led to music becoming homogenized, or at least the listening experience: I suspect that the general tone of music has shifted towards accomodating the algorithm, but that there is still as much distinctive music as ever. Since What.CD faded into obscurity, my listening habits have drastically changed. Discover weekly makes things anomalous, music as generic blobbery. A background rather than foreground experience.
