From [interaction-design.org](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/skeuomorphism#:~:text=Skeuomorphism%20is%20a%20term%20most,icon%20used%20for%20discarding%20files.):

> Skeuomorphism is a term most often used in graphical user interface design to describe interface objects that *mimic* their real-world counterparts in how they appear and/or how the user can interact with them. A well-known example is the recycle bin icon used for discarding files. Skeuomorphism makes interface objects familiar to users by using concepts they recognize.

In effect, skeuomorphism is a kind of [[metaphor]] (see [[Interface Design and Metaphor]]).  A very blunt one: a one-to-one representation of things in "real life" to things in digital life. This seemed to be one of the original trends of graphic user interfaces, though as computing metaphors have grown on their own, it's slowly disappeared. For a broader look at combinations of physical/digital beyond this weird one, see [[Digital and Physical (Analog) Prime]].

Contra skeuomorphism as a design trend, see [[The great flattening of digitization as an aesthetic]].

For a design trend rabbit hole, the Aesthetics Wiki defines [Frutiger Aero](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Frutiger_Aero):

> **Frutiger Aero** is an aesthetic that was prevalent from roughly 2005 to 2013. It is characterized by its use of skeuomorphism, glossy textures, use of nature and humanism, use of bright and vibrant colours (usually contrasted on a white or monochrome background), and use of glass.
