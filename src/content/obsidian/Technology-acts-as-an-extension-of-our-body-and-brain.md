questions to consider:

* in what ways does it fail? or prioritize one mode ie text/typing? what about touch?
* how is the body engaged? sitting, thumbs. elgato pedal is an interesting full body extension. then theres VR and oculus. and obviously the stream deck - giving a tactile feel. [[Mixing physical with digital (computing and physicality)]]
* of course, [[Dynamicland]]
* when i say “technology” i really mean digital technology, not “hard” technology like infrastructure - right?
