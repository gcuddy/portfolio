From a comment on [[Sacasas2021Notes-From-the-Metaverse]] by Christian Ely

> I've been practicing the art of theatre for over thirty-five years. The effect of television and film has crippled the audience's ability to engage in verisimilitude, the willing suspension of disbelief, catharsis, and empathy. Because we can't go back, the theatre is constantly asked to create grander and more ridiculous spectacles. While these virtual spaces are not going anywhere, and as you said, we can't go back, it is important to learn to sit in a room and watch a story unfold sans pageantry. Both iterations of story have their place, both are important, but we need to remember to practice simplicity, listening, and imagination.

The [[Metaverse]] — the creation of another digital reality that lives "on top" of our current one — presents an interesting conundrum for theater.

Theater requires an audience to desire to maintain connection with reality, and then to collectively conjure an *alternate* reality via sculpting/moving energy in three-dimensional space.

Will this kind of analog presence still have a place in the future? Certainly Broadway and commercial theater will still have a place, as Disney's effect cannot be understated.

Smaller theater will have to work to carve out a space for itself. But part of me believes it's more than possible to not just maintain at a modest scale, but to have it be an escape from the metaverse — an underground purveyor of cool, a space to connect with real live human beings (other live events go here too, I guess, like parties and concerts). (Perhaps that's just the steampunk in me tho.)
