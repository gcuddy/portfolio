Creating artful web projects on the internet allows for a fascinating marriage of form and content. That is: the form can be shaped and molded to appropriately — or inappropriately! — contain the content. For more, see: [[Reading on the web is underrated, but doesn't beat print 20220105115209]]

In fact, the internet is *inseparable* from form. Any web page is a formal container for content, and each web page will presumably look a bit different. When we put something on the internet, then, we *have* to consider its form as well.

Here's Robin Sloan, [talking to Dan Shipper in Superorganizers](https://every.to/superorganizers/tasting-notes-with-robin-sloan-25629085):

> I describe myself as a ‘media inventor’, which I know sounds like a strange label. To me, it means that a lot of my work – not really my novels, but almost everything else – involves **inventing a format or container at the same time that I’m writing or imagining what goes into it**.
> This might be because I’m a member of what some people call ‘the Oregon Trail generation’ –  those who played Oregon Trail on Macs when we were in elementary school back in the late ‘80s. We grew up with computers and the internet, but in a way that was kind of in-between our parents’ generation, who had the internet dropped down on them like a ton of bricks, and people younger than us, who grew up in a world where the internet was everywhere, like oxygen or sunlight.
> I learned from using those Macs early on that **form is always malleable**. This became even more apparent when the web came into the picture. Think about it: **==there’s no way to make a web page or a blog that is not an act of playing with its form at the same time as you're creating its content==**. So it just seemed natural: the world was always telling me that you worked on those two things – the container and its contents – together.

There’s an oprresiveness to the tyranny of social media squares and the same mauve colors. See [[Everything in web2 looks the same]] and [[The great flattening of digitization as an aesthetic]]
