I want to read [[The Bible]]....

2022-06-11 Thinking about this more in honor of the dear [[Ian Schaefer]], whose [[Catholicism ⟁]] was a real inspiration.

![[2022-06-11#^a7b9a0]]

Concepts/Things:

* [[Angels]]

Thinkers/Writers:

* Sacasas
* [[Ivan Illich]]
* Tosltoy
* (in a sense) [[Karl Ove Knausgaard]]
* Alan Jacobs
* [[Rene Girard]]

Painters:

* [[Ian Schaefer]] favorite painting was "[[The Angelus]]" by [[Jean Francois Millet]]
  * not explicitly about christianity but it's a prayer

The idea that evil exists but God still exists (i.e. why does god lets bad things happen to good people?): [[Theodicy]]

Poetry and history:
