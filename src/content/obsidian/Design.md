> Semantic nitpick: “design” and “look and feel” are two very different—if related—things. To design a thing is to *design*-ate what is and is not important to the thing; it’s not about making it pretty. See also Mike Monteiro’s [*Ruined by Design: How Designers Destroyed the World* 4](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/44432844-ruined-by-design), Don Norman’s [*The Design of Everyday Things* 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things), Richard Buchanan’s [*Wicked Problems in Design Thinking* 2](https://www.scaruffi.com/peace/buchanan1.pdf)… (I know that this probably looks like a silly thing to debate, but I think it’s an important distinction. I’ll try to demo that here…)
