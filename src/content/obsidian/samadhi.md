# samadhi

I find Rob Burbea's idea of [[Creative Samadhi Rob Burbea lecture|creative samadhi]] to be most useful.

He translates samadhi as more than just concentration, but actually a type of "harmonization".

Samadhi should *feel good*. You're like a potter at the wheel, improvising, just making your pot and seeing what feels nice.

You could try:

* Energy body 0 turn up brightness, radiate joy
* Breathing into different parts, breath as gift
* Energy body contracting/expanding
* metta

What you're looking for is to discern well-being, tune in, and then *amplify it*. With enough amplification you may generate [[piti]] and reach the first [[jhanas|jhana]].

Relationship of samadhi and insight practice: see [[Threefold Training]]

Practices lead into each other. But often we do samadhi/jhana and then have that be the fertile soil for insight practice.

Defining  Samadhi:

#note/refactor:: restructure into more of an index/moc and resolve file conflicts

[[samadhi (samādhi) is more than just concentration]]

[[Samadhi is about opening, not just sharpening]]

[[samādhi is nourishment, not just concentration]]

[[Samadhi should be pleasurable]]
