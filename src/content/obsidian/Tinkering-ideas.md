- Alfred ripgrep
- [[2021-12-21]]  my own digital garden plugin for eleventy (probably), inspired by andy's
	- there's already an existing one but it doesn't support embeds or transclusions — I'd like to support obsidian syntax too
		- https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-content-blocks?activeTab=readme
- quick append to a heading in any file with Alfred, formatting with a task or list or timestamp by holding down keys
- Read lAter app (slash bookmarking) that’s way better than everything else and that respects web design
- Letterboxd plug-in for Obsidian
- script to download all liked tweets into obsidian, or manually download (with command and url scheme)
- Another plugin idea: a better gallery view. it gets all your images that are linked form files in your vault, and then you can view your notes in that sort of index card style with pictures on them.
- add delete note and move note to right click menu from dataview
- bulk actions for dataview
