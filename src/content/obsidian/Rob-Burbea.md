Meditation teacher who is hailed as perhaps the greatest contemporary Western dharma teacher, at least in my corner of Twitter. Sadly passed away in 2020.

He leaves behind an incredible wealth of talks that he gave on Dharma Seed, as well as his seminal book [[Seeing That Frees]].

[There is a wonderful project that transcribes all his talks](https://airtable.com/shr9OS6jqmWvWTG5g/tblHlCKWIIhZzEFMk/viw3k0IfSo0Dve9ZJ/rec5JWpJ4she7EvGP/fldJfzyMJCDaGCKom/attsoGlB9XgCcZrkw), which is absolutely indispensable.

My enjoyment (and the fruits) of concentration practice
increased when I treated it more as an art than a mechanical
process.
Rob Burbea teaches concentration in a way that opens this
up; emphasizing play, experimentation, etc.
