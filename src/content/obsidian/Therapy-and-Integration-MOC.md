> Psychotherapy can be tremendously valuable to people starting with Global Wayfinding. Good psychotherapy can help you with all seven parts of Global Wayfinding. Psychotherapy can be done by yourself, or with a professional psychotherapist.
>
> Types of psychotherapy that I have either had good experience with, or heard good things about, are:
>
> * [[Internal Family Systems]] (as presented by Jay Early in his book¬†*[[ñ†´ Self-Therapy - Jay Earley]]*)
> * *Core Transformation*¬†by Connirae Andreas and Tamara Andreas ->
> * *Feeding Your Demons*¬†by Tsultrim Allione (the appendix and practice are more useful than the rest of the book)
> * Eugene Gendlin‚Äôs¬†*Focusing*¬†(a technique and book by the same name)
>
> If you are familiar Gendlin‚Äôs Focusing, you might consider looking into Mark‚Äôs previous work, titled¬†*Folding*, available¬†[here](https://www.scribd.com/document/411528411/Folding-1-0-by-Mark-Lippmann-pdf). Folding is a sort of extension of Focusing. However, do note that Folding is officially deprecated as a solitary practice. It is still considered a preliminary/auxiliary practice, though, and as such may be useful for starting out.
>
> There are two large limitations of psychotherapy that I am aware of. The first is that it can be too intellectual, and insufficiently involve the body. The second is that psychotherapy can be too inflexible, and get stuck and stop progressing if one doesn‚Äôt evolve the underlying framework and practices (both of these are reasons for¬†*Folding*‚Äôs deprecation as a solitary practice). For an example of how you might evolve the underlying framework: in Internal Family Systems you might only relate to parts by talking with them. This might be useful at first, but eventually stop being useful, because you need to communicate with parts pre-linguistically. You might also find that the ‚Äúparts‚Äù model stops working well at some point, and that parts don‚Äôt cleanly divide into discrete things, or that there are dynamics at play that aren‚Äôt acknowledged by IFS. All of these things can bottleneck or stall progress.
