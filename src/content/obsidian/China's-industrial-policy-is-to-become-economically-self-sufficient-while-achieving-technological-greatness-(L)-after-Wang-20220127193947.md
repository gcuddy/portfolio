# China's industrial policy is to become economically self-sufficient while achieving technological greatness, after Wang

[[China]] mostly relies on government ministries and state enterprises to drive industrial growth. There is a core tension here, though, because state-funded industrial growth in China hasn't been as successful as China's private entrepreneurial firms, which run largely under capitalist models. The state plays a balancing act with these private entities, as of course private interests don't always align with the state's goal of strengthening domestic technology. 

Interestingly, when Trump tightened [[United States]] trade restrictions in 2018, Chinese companies were cut off from U.S. technology that they relied on, like semiconductors. This, against U.S. intentions, forced Chinese companies to reinvent this technology, or otherwise find domestic alternatives. This ended up making private companies' incentives line up with the state's economic goals — what the Chinese government couldn't seem to accomplish on their own. (To be clear, it's not what Trump intended either!)

For more on how China encourages this technological self-sufficiency, see [[China propaganda culture focuses on state-aligned goals that have industrial prowess, like making semiconductors 20220205175242]], or my notes on [[Chinese Internet]].

For the most part, it has relied on government ministries and state-owned enterprises to pursue these goals, and for the most part, it has come up short. In semiconductor production, for example, China has barely crossed the starting line.
