#note/boat 

see some of my efforts with [[schema.org]], as well as several new plugins and apps that atempt to give notes “types”

related: how far does that type metaphor extend? and is it useful, or limiting? ie is it an engineer-only type context, or something more for everyone? in computers and beyond?
